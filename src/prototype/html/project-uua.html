		<p>The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) is a <a href="http://www.uua.org/documents/info/uua_infosheet.pdf">religious organization</a> that <a href="http://www.uua.org/beliefs/principles/index.shtml">affirms the worth of human beings</a>, advocates for freedom of belief and the search for advancing truth, and tries to provide a warm, open, supportive community for people who believe that ethical living is the supreme witness of religion.
		</p>
		<p>The UUA came to CoLab with an in-house technical team in place that needed Drupal expertise to assist them with leaving a proprietary and expensive CMS system.  The project involved porting their thousands of pages of data over to Drupal 7 and structuring that data such that it was relevant and meaningful to their congregations and their clergy who use the online content to provide inspirational religious services. </p>

<div class="container margin-top">
		 <p>Due to the complexity of the UUA's organizational needs including:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li> Development of an intranet</li>
		<li> Development of multiple portal sites</li>
		<li> Support an editorial workflow for an online magazine</li>
		<li> Architectural design for content sharing across all properties</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The project involved an extensive planning, discovery, and technical problem solving kick off phase.  CoLab also provided capacity building on development using on agile development processes during this initial phase as it was clear that this project needed to be a "learning project" where the team began work quickly while concurrently researching and designing solutions that were fed into the development process using agile methodologies.</p>
		
		<p>After the initial planning, training and technical discovery phase, CoLab jumped into the trenches alongside the UUA team helping to develop the most complex aspects of the Drupal 7 migration site while continuing to provide technical oversight in the form of regular code reviews and scrum meetings.  Further, CoLab provided ongoing training to the UUA team on issues of relevance to the development process so the the in-house UUA team was growing in expertise while also working to meet their technical delivery goals in migrating off of Crown Peak and onto Drupal 7.</p>
		
		<p>All told this project is a classic example of the spirit of collaboration CoLab encourages with our clients. In partnership we worked to both implement solutions to significant technical challenges while also building capacity in the UUA team.</p>
