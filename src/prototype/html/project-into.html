	<!--<p>INTO came to CoLab with a bold challenge: to be the preeminent mobile storytelling platform for the green economy.  With plans to target customers like Whole Foods, Fair Trade USA, and Sambazon; we were excited to help the company get traction from their MVP product while building an enterprise grade application, CMS and API that could meet the needs of their enterprise clients for the long-term.</p>
	
	<p>Part of the beauty of this project was taking an idea with great technical and business complexity and distill it down to an elegant technical solution that was easy to use and emotionally compelling.  Companies quickly understood the power of the INTO product in helping them to share their stories with their customers, and the company was quickly tracked for success from there.</p>
	
	<p>Key Points:</p>
	<ul class="list-dashes">
	<li>Online Storytelling Platform for the Green Economy</li>
	<li>Native iOS mobile application and web platform with extensive UX / Design</li>

	<p>Success came quickly for INTO once CoLab began working with the client as the INTO team began sharing the initial sales minimum viable product at trade-shows while setting up one on one meetings with the most successful companies of the green economy even securing pre-sales commitments to the product offering while still under development.  By helping the client to establish market and product fit quickly and definitively, CoLab helped the client to successfully raise additional capital and further invest in its product development and market roll-out strategy. </p>
