CoLab has always been about community and cooperation. We are all human and we thrive on our diversity. We will not tolerate anything or anyone who puts this at risk. As the focus of our work lives at the intersection of technology and movements giving voice, power, and justice to oppressed or marginalized populations, we cannot simply remain silent given the current events and political climate in the U.S. 


We recognize that our nation’s systems, including but not limited to law enforcement, education, housing, healthcare, and finances are racist. We condemn police brutality. We support actions taken by oppressed people fighting for their own justice and freedom. We believe that reform is necessary for our institutions to be truly equitable and just. 


It’s our job to unlearn the racist messaging we have received our entire lives and to actively do the work of becoming anti-racist. We acknowledge that this work is not comfortable or easy, but it is our responsibility if we truly care for our brothers and sisters in the black and brown community to walk this road. Reading a book can be a simple step on this path. There are many, but a couple we suggest are:

<a href="https://www.ibramxkendi.com/how-to-be-an-antiracist-1">How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi</a>

<a href="https://www.farmingwhileblack.org/">Farming While Black by Leah Penniman</a>

To support this process we are seeking out voices in our communities that are not usually heard from so that we can integrate new perspectives into our work of mutual aid, solidarity, and economic justice. We hope to support ongoing efforts to reshape society according to their unique perspectives and needs. 

At CoLab we are committed to doing the work to root out racism in our own lives and to support each other on this path. We value our global and diverse team and are active in listening to and uplifting the voices and ideas of our coworkers and community members who are non-white.  

As <a href="https://scottwoodsmakeslists.wordpress.com/2014/01/03/5-things-no-one-is-actually-saying-about-ani-difranco-or-plantations/">Scott Wood notes</a>, “There is no anti-racist certification class. It’s a set of socioeconomic traps and cultural values that are fired up every time we interact with the world. #It is a thing you have to keep scooping out of the boat of your life to keep from drowning in it.#”

To continue scooping the water of racism out of our respective boats is to do our best to live up to our nation’s highest ideals. As Barack Obama notes, “If we want our criminal justice system, and American society at large, to operate on a higher ethical code, then we have to model that code ourselves.” Taking action in both protest and politics where we are able. Doing what we can to <a href="https://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/kivel3.pdf">be strong allies</a>. 

As part of our efforts to uplift voices of color and those actively working for social and economic justice, we’d like to highlight some of our past and present partners. Please support them in ways that you are able:
