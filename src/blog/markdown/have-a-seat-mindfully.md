# Have A Seat, Mindfully

Really enjoying taking time out of the work day to sit in silence together with other CoLabrs. Some of us seasoned practitioners of one mindfullness philosophy or another. Others simply embracing the time to breathe, reset or recalibrate. In either case, a subtle but deep connection is happening between peers. This humble weekly tradition embodies our approach to work, and creates value to our lives.

Here are some of things those who are joining the weekly sit are saying about the experience:

<p>The weekly sit tradition at CoLab is a treasured time for connecting with CoLabrs, centering one's mind, and bringing forth a calm and renewed energy. I think our weekly sit embodies all of CoLab's core values: wisdom and passion for mindful culture, collaboration in meditation, sustainability in holistic well-being, and innovation to keep the torch lit in the face of day-to-day business.</p></div>

<p>The weekly sit provides a center for my work schedule, it helps me bring the core practice of right-living directly at the core of my work life, my seva life, and a context that can so often become one of total compulsion and anxiety. It also connects me with a community that is deeply aligned yet outside the constrains of a single project, mission or goal. This helps me focus, be more present with those I'm trying to work with and support, and craft a more sustainable work life.</p></div>

<p>Prior to joining CoLab, I was not a regular meditator - though I have long been conscious of the potential benefits, particularly for my mind-set, and have aspired to someday incorporate a regular meditation practice into my life. Since joining CoLab a month ago, I still have not created the time/space in my life for a regular, intentional meditation practice - except during the CoLab Mid-Week Sit.  This scheduled time, and the facilitation and company of my fellow CoLabrs, has finally enabled me to begin to bring a dedicated mindful meditation practice into my life.  </p>

<p>Although my experience of this group practice, and of silent seated meditation in general, is still limited, it has already brought real, visceral benefit to me, as a person and as a CoLabr.  In the midst of a day of meetings and a week of work, with my mind racing with multiple projects and ideas and my balance thrown by perceived time pressures and competing priorities within and outside of CoLab, the mid-week sit provides respite, calm, grounding, and perspective, which allow me to return to work, and life, more balanced, focused, and renewed.  As minutiae of immediate tasks obstruct my view of the bigger picture, the mid-week sit also helps me to truly see and hear the CoLabrs around me, and reminds me of what is special about CoLab and why I am interested in being a part of it and helping it to grown and thrive. </p></div>
