# We're Hiring Collaborators

Are you looking for work in a positive collaborative environment where cooperation and heart-centered actions take precedence? Are you inspired to participate in a progressive economy business?  Would you like to be able to work flexible hours and from any location?

Colab Cooperative, a 2 year old worker-owned company based in NY & CA is looking for a web developer to join our team.  This position will start on a freelance basis, and after an initial trial period may expand into full-time work if we find mutual benefit in our work together. Web ninjas are welcome to apply.

Main development responsibilities would be:
- Translate visual comps into modern, responsive, and semantic HTML & CSS
- Integrate dynamic content into sites using JQuery and JQuery extensions
- Research optimal solutions for problems faced by our clients
- Knowledge of PHP and/or Ruby is a plus
- Experience with Drupal and Wordpress a major plus

In terms of personal qualities we seek:
- A self-starter, who is internally motivated to learn and continue growing
- A responsible communicator who delivers on what they promise with their words
- A team player who keeps folks in the loop on where they are at and is transparent about what is going on.

If this sounds exciting, please [send us]() your work history, your salary requirements, a minimum 100 word description of why you would want to work with our cooperative, and a few words as to where your heartâ€™s inspiration lies.  Replies without a description will not be considered.
