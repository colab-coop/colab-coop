# Taking it to heart

<img src="/assets/img/blog/lighthouse2017.jpg" class="center-element">

This last year has been a struggle. Women speaking out about violence are being heard with [#metoo](https://metoomvmt.org/). Immigrant rights defenders are showing up more visibly than ever. Cooperative ownership models are emerging in every industry where economic justice matters - which is to say, everywhere. We wholeheartedly believe in embracing the struggle, and not tolerating suffering. And, we’re investing in that critical work. 

Over the summer, we held internal trainings on non-violent communication. In October, we helped sponsor [Web of Change](www.webofchange.com), a five-day retreat for digital organizers, where Danny led a workshop on co-ops VS startups. This week, we pooled funds for our first internal innovation fellowship, enabling Tomaz to prototype an app to share secrets securely, like leaking or whistleblowing. And in the coming months, we hope to finally work with sister co-op [Core Staffing](www.corestaffing.us), a Baltimore-based agency for returning citizens finding employment, while dismantling barriers to good work and changing the criminal justice system. 

It has been a struggle to put our values first, but it’s working. In 2017, CoLab has grown by 6 new coworkers with over a dozen projects where our values align. [Reach out](http://colab.coop/contact/) if you want to take it to heart with us, too.
