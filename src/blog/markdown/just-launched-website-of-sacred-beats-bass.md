# Just Launched: Website of Sacred Beats & Bass

<a href="http://dubkirtan.com/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2013-02-28.png" class="center-element"></a>

Dub Kirtan All-Stars new site is live and chock full of sonic and social sharing goodness. It’s the latest of CoLab’s pro-bono projects supporting music and art.

Formed by [David Starfire](http://davidstarfire.com/) and [FreQ Nasty](http://www.freqnasty.com/), Dub Kirtan fuses a bass heavy underground dance sound with Yoga Kirtan, the call and response chants of Indian devotional traditions. They are a live band/DJ collective that tears down the boundaries between bleeding edge technology and ancient spiritual techniques, performer, audience, the sacred and everyday life.

This is not the first time CoLab has collaborated with this crew. The site's designer, [Rylan Peery](http://colab.coop/team) (aka Solar Lion), is also part of the all star’s family of performers. Additionally, FreQ Nasty has worked with CoLab on the Giveback campaign, which supports positive change through music.
