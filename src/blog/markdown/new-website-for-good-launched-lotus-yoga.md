# New Website For Good, Launched: Lotus Yoga!

<a href="http://www.lotusyogamontclair.com/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2011-05-19.jpg" class="center-element"></a>

We are excited to announce the launch of [Lotus Yoga’s new website](http://www.lotusyogamontclair.com/). Lotus Yoga is a studio in the New Jersey metro area with locations in Newark and Montclair. We at CoLab love projects involving yoga, but this one is even more special because Lotus Yoga is more than a great yoga studio. Founder Jennifer Kohl is dedicated to service and community. For example she created a unique yoga program at a juvenile detention center in Newark, where she volunteers by teaching a weekly class to detainees. This dedication to bringing the benefits of yoga to the greater community is inspiring.

The new site features both creative and technical work from the Colab team. [Jessica Peery](http://colab.coop/team) designed Lotus Yoga’s brand identity which sits beautiful and bold above this text. [Rylan Peery](http://colab.coop/team) created the site’s elegant and easy to navigate interface. [Jayme Peck](http://colab.coop/team) installed the Expression Engine multi-site manager which allows Jennifer and Lotus to manage content for two sites in one place.

It was and is truly a great experience working with Jennifer and helping contribute to positive change in the world. We are now moving forward with the design and development of the site for [Lotus In Action](http://lotusinaction.com/), a nonprofit Jennifer founded devoted to serving at-risk youth in their communities. Jennifer works tirelessly serving others, and we couldn’t be more happy to be helping her amplify her efforts.
