# Mid-Week Oasis of Love!

This week we celebrated in honor of our visiting West Coast member Yaniv and his lovely newlywed partner Sara, with a little mid week soirée.. It was also an opportunity to share the work of artist [Joshua Sperling](http://www.joshuasperling.com/), who has helped deck out the [CoLab Hive Coworking](http://www.colabhive.com/) space in recent months.  Lastly, it was also an excuse to give out Free Hugs to some peers, lovers, collaborators and supporters of cooperative economy, as Tuesdays can get be pretty hectic.

Thanks to some off the charts snacks from Ithaca local [Serendipity Catering](http://serendipitycatering.biz/) and a collection of true and remarkable peeps in attendance, we CoLabrs came away feeling thrilled and inspired. Seems like the sentiment was felt by all.

So with out further adiue, a few shout-outs…In no particular order..
Ethan and Anaar, NYC’s finest Colleen Clark, Jason with
[Art & Anthropolgy](http://www.artandanthropology.com/), Joshua Sperling, Leon of Singlebrook fame, in house developer Jayme Peck and his family, Tim Cole, who if you dont know, is kind of a big deal... Karen, my little man Gus, Jessica, [Anna Coogan](http://www.annacoogan.com/), our latest Hive member [Valentin](http://www.knowded.com/), ‘The Clojure’ Travis Vachon, and all the folks who alllmost showed up.
