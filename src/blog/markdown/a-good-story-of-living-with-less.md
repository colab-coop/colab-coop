# A Good Story Of Living With Less

<img src="/assets/img/blog/2013-03-11.jpg" class="center-element">

Seems like every time I click on the NYT these days, I’m inspired or at least reassured that momentum is shifting, people are waking up and choosing a path with less greed, ego and blind consumption involved. The last blog post was sparked by a New York Times article, and here again, I am finding the words of Graham Hill (founder of [LifeEdited.com](http://www.lifeedited.com/) and [TreeHugger.com](http://www.treehugger.com/)) resonating in harmony with core Coop values.

> Intuitively, we know that the best stuff in life isn’t stuff at all, and that relationships, experiences and meaningful work are the staples of a happy life.

> My success and the things it bought quickly changed from novel to normal. Soon I was numb to it all. The new Nokia phone didn’t excite me or satisfy me. It didn’t take long before I started to wonder why my theoretically upgraded life didn’t feel any better and why I felt more anxious than before.

The [full article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/opinion/sunday/living-with-less-a-lot-less.html?pagewanted=all) is worthwhile, a recommended read with love from CoLab.
