# A New Website For A Folk Artist Dear To Our Heart

Through the community that is blossoming from our co-work space in Ithaca ([CoLab Hive](http://www.colabhive.com/)), we connected with a tremendously talented opera turned folk singer name [Anna Coogan](http://www.annacoogan.com/). With many of us Coop folk being musicians ourselves, we were thrilled when Anna approached us about redesigning her website.

We understand the importance of website simplicity for the independent artist who is managing themselves or working with a small, often overwhelmed staff. We also know that with an artist site comes the need for a lot of features and integration. From tour dates to song downloads to streaming media, keeping it all up to date and feeling fresh can be a daunting task.

Passionately, we rose to the challenge. Just in time for Annaâ€™s showcase at the [International Folk Alliance Festival](http://www.folkalliance.org/conference/) in Tennessee!  Now she can spend more promoting (and playing) her sweet, fresh heart felt music, and less time tangled in technical difficulties.
