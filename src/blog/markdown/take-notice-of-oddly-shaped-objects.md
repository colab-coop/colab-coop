# Take Notice of Oddly Shaped Objects

CoLab has launched a new version of James Huang’s website featuring his one-of-a-kind sculptural masterpieces.

Our lovable team of collaborators [Jayme](http://colab.coop/team), [Dejan](http://colab.coop/team), [Smriti](http://colab.coop/team), and [Cris](http://colab.coop/team), not unlike the fantastic four, combined their strengths to rescue Huang’s site from static HTML and launch it into a dynamic WordPress set-up that Huang can update and adjust as he sees fit. We’ve also added a blog where the artist will hopefully share his thoughts and new creations.

CoLab is grateful for this opportunity to support the arts. We are proud to help James, a long-time client, bring his unique perspective to all of us who are sitting behind our computers longing for something wild, evocative, and inspiring. Go ahead and move to the edge of your seat right now, prepare yourself for a journey, and check out James Huang’s [new website](http://james-huang.com/).
