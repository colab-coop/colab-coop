# Furnish Sustainably with mebl

<img src="/assets/img/blog/mebl1.JPG" class="center-element">

People of NYC, your dreams of beautiful furniture have finally come true! We are very happy to announce that our collaborator, mebl/*transforming furniture*, will be hosting a pop-up show from October 15 to November 3. mebl sources wood furniture made of recycled materials — think disused barns and retired canoes — from all over the world, offering truly stunning furniture to those who care about the future of the planet. We couldn’t agree more with mebl’s desire to build a more sustainable and beautiful world. 

Come say hello, in person, to Michael Hirschhorn or check out [mebl’s website](http://meblfurniture.com) for more information about gorgeous, re-purposed furniture.
