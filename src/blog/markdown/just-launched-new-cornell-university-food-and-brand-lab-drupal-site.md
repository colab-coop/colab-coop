# Just Launched: New Cornell University Food and Brand Lab Drupal Site

CoLab’s latest project is live! The <a href="http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/">new website for the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab</a> connects its audience with the latest research on the interaction between food science, marketing. and psychology. The mission of the Food and Brand Lab is to provide information that empowers consumers to make informed decisions about their food habits. The Lab also provides resources for journalists, policymakers, and educators who are working with the public in order to promote better nutrition among children and adults. They needed a robust online platform, capable of effectively translating a variety of multimedia content to a diverse audience, which CoLab delivered.

We had a lot of affinity with the Brand Lab going into this project. Using technology to empower people at the grassroots level is an important part of CoLab’s identity; the Brand Lab’s work in bringing informative research to its audience is very much in the same spirit. Throughout this project, our development team enjoyed a close collaboration with members of the Brand Lab, resulting in a finished product that represents the strengths of both teams.

The new design enables the Brand Lab’s audience to easily navigate through a broad selection of content; it’s mobile-responsive, optimized to interact with social media, and reflects the Brand Lab’s national leadership in the field of Food Psychology. We’re very happy with what we accomplished alongside the Brand Lab’s team, and we’re proud to support their ongoing efforts to  invent healthy eating solutions for consumers, companies, and communities.
