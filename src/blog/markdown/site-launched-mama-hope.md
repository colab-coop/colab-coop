# Site Launched: Mama Hope

<a href="http://mamahope.org/">Mama Hope</a> is a non-profit organization focused on building self-sufficient communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. The organization has completed 50 projects in four countries, impacting more than 150,000 lives in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana.

It was a fast-paced project, moving through an organizational rebranding, platform migration (WordPress to Squarespace), and content overhaul in two months.

The site launch was timed for Mama Hope's <a href="http://www.mamahope.org/unlock-potential/">Men for Women</a> campaign: a compilation of clips from men around the world, talking about the women they love and their vision for women in the future.

This was our second project with the Mama Hope team, an encore to the 2013 <a href="/work/stop-the-pity/">Stop the Pity</a> campaign.
