# Building Just, Local Economies

CoLab has been working with partners on an exciting new project that we're happy to share with you: the NYC-based Coopify app!

Coopify is a platform - soon to be rebranded - aimed at connecting NYC community members with co-op service providers.  We’re unveiling a Friends and Family Launch of the platform at the <a href="http://platformcoop.net/2016">Platform Cooperativism</a> event in November, and we invite you to take part. Rylan Peery, a co-founder of CoLab will be sharing stage with Emma Yorra from Center for Family Life, outlining Coopify’s key benefits and sharing the dream of a co-operative future. Our planned release includes an opportunity for NYC folks to purchase holiday gift certificates for their friends, family, and co-workers.  A gift that gives twice!

## An introduction to a platform for living wages

When you purchase services in New York City like house-keeping, dog-walking, and tutoring through Coopify (vs. Handy, Task Rabbit, etc), you contribute a maximum percentage of your service cost to the workers themselves, supporting an important economic justice initiative for local providers.  Your dollars go into workers' pockets.

As a customer, you’ll receive a better quality of service and greater care from dedicated service professionals.

Ecomundo Cleaning Cooperative, United Handymen, Sunset Scholars Tutoring Cooperative, and Trusty Amigos Dog Walking and Pet Care Cooperative are among the first pioneers to launch America’s premiere service-cooperative app.

From housecleaning and dog walking to home repair, New York city residents have a unique opportunity to purchase services online that meet their personal needs while moving their communities towards a socially just economy.    

With the Coopify app, you provide the details of your needs and then get connected with co-op service providers working in your neighborhood. Booking and payment are handled online, and funds go directly to the worker co-ops.  There are also features allowing for establishing long-term relationships with the workers themselves.
 
CoLab is honored to be collaborating with the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park to help build a local, just economy.
