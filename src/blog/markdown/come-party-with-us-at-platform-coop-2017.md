# Come Party with Us at Platform Coop 2017

<img src="/assets/img/blog/platformcoop2017.jpg" class="center-element">

We are excited to convene an after party for our fellow platform-coop obsessed tech developers and platform designers to come together and learn from one-another, connect, and co-create the future of coops. Held one day after the [Platform Coop Conference](http://platform.coop/2017), this event aims to identify a platform coop toolkit by discussing existing technologies that support Platform Coop development projects. We hope to nurture a community of mutual support for technologists and designers who work on—or are interested in working on—platform cooperative projects. We’ll meet in an open space format to discuss projects, share tools, and collaborate on building technological infrastructure for the platform coop economy.
