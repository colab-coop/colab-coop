# CoLab Named To Support Historic Camp Sagamore With Mobile Experience

<img src="/assets/img/blog/2016-01-29.jpg" class="center-element" alt="View of Great Camp Sagamore">

With a planning grant from the New York State Council for the Arts, [Great Camp Sagamore ](http://greatcampsagamore.org/) will be pursuing a plan for interpretive strategies in a historic and wilderness environment. The grant brings together museum interpretation ([Cooperstown Graduate Program](http://www.oneonta.edu/academics/cgp/)), marketing ([AdWorkshop of Lake Placid](https://www.adworkshop.com/lake-placid "Adirondack Integrated Marketing Agency | Adworkshop")), mobile computer applications (That's Us!) and education ([New York State Art Teachers Association](http://www.nysata.org/ "NYSATA Home")) for what promises to be a potent collaboration. 

The ideas to explore range from sigange scattered through out the area to an interactive mobile application enriching visitor experience with historic photos, video footage, art an music.  

This grant for consultation sets up Sagamore to receive a larger grant package for implementation of the plan in subsequent years. Exciting news to come out the gate with in 2016!
