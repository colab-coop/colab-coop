# When Life Gives You Waste...

CoLab is proud to announce the launch of the newly redesigned [Pivot Works website](http://www.pivotworks.co/pivot-works/).

The intellectual and creative energies of [Jenn](http://colab.coop/team), [Rylan](http://colab.coop/team), [Cris](http://colab.coop/team) and [Aman](http://colab.coop/team) came together to present a new design that embodies the clean energy efficiency lying at the heart of the Pivot Works Project.

Pivot works is an inspiring social enterprise helping communities around the world solve their sanitation and energy problems by turning human waste into hygienic, high-efficiency fuel. The Pivot Works Project improves community health, supports local economies, and addresses serious environmental concerns all by improving sanitation. CoLab is deeply grateful to support such a cause!
