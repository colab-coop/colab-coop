<p>Enspiral is a collective of companies and individuals helping people work on stuff that matters. There are 15 or so ventures in the network with a 50/50 split between professional services and building products. A big focus is on network based, decentralized organizing and using the tools of business to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>I work with two of our ventures, [Enspiral Dev Academy](http://devacademy.co.nz/) (programmer bootcamp) and Enspiral Craftworks (contracting team), as well as helping out with the foundation board and our <a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/exAKrBUp/open-app-ecosystem">Open App</a> project (an open source suite of apps focused on decentralized organizing).</p>

<p>Collaboration is the heart of Enspiral. The majority of my work is collaborative. I pair on a lot of my work. Even when not pairing, there's a review process where someone else will run through things and provide feedback.</p>
<p>There's a daily standup at Dev Academy and virtual daily standup on Slack for Craftworks. Dev Academy holds weekly retrospectives and Open App holds monthly check-ins on Loomio. Dev Academy also holds feedback sessions every month or two. Most teams hold a retreat every six months, when we also have our full network retreats.</p>

<p>We use [Loomio](http://loomio.org) for decision-making, [Cobudget](http://cobudget.co) for budgeting and [Slack](https://slack.com/) for chat. Google Apps, Trello, and Doodle are all key.</p>
<p>We have a missing gap in our communication stack for slow-moving, forum-type discussions. Yammer used to do that for us but they made product choices that led to our users abandoning it. Right now we're using Google Plus, which people don't really like, so we're actively looking for a replacement.</p>

<p>Every day. Today, at Dev Academy, we had a team conversation about our new remuneration process where <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=colabcoop&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uJDSNc&text=Everyone%20sets%20their%20own%20salary%20which%20is%20shared%20transparently%20throughout%20the%20company.">everyone sets their own salary, which is shared transparently throughout the company</a>. All salary requests are approved by default. If anyone has an issue with how much someone pays themselves, it's resolved through our conflict resolution process. We were  inspired by <a href="https://bufferapp.com/transparency">Buffer's work with transparency</a> and are thinking about how to make our company more transparent.</p>

<p>Last year, the Loomio team had to cut back on the number of people they were employing. This would normally be a really painful decision for a company, with dramatic impacts on the individuals involved. Because the strength of the connections in the network, Enspiral Craftworks was able to find roles for all the people involved. Despite being separate companies, it looked more like an internal transfer than a mass redundancy.</p>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">Where have you seen collaboration break down, and what lessons were learned?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-21_1.jpg"></div>
<div class="overflow-hidden">
<p>We've had a co-working space for the past few years. It has always been a challenge to manage. Essentially, lots of people want a place to work but no one really wants to run a co-working business.</p>

<p>The people who hold everything together often do so out of obligation and responsibility rather than doing the work which most brings them alive. It is difficult for us to bring in new people, as the finances in that business are marginal and folks are generally underpaid for their work. The big lesson for me has been: when there's work that needs doing which people aren't naturally drawn towards, you need to resource it really well.</p>

<p>I've found that when you remove structure from a hierarchy you don't get collaboration, you get informal hierarchy. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=colabcoop&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uJDSNc&text=To%20build%20true%20decentralization%20takes%20good%20processes%20and%20conscious%20effort.">To build true decentralization takes good processes and conscious effort</a> from everyone in the organization.</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-21_1.jpg"></div>
<div class="overflow-hidden">
<p>I think the enquiry into leadership in both centralized and decentralized organizations is fascinating. Often what people think of as centralized leadership is just bad leadership. When done well, there are similarities in both environments. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=colabcoop&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uJDSNc&text=Good%20leaders%20will%20always%20serve%20the%20people%20they%20lead.">Good leaders will always serve the people they lead</a> and will always empower people to have a lot of autonomy.</p>

<p>Interesting things emerge when you take away coercive power and add radical transparency. When everything leaders do is visible across the organization &mdash; they only have influence, not authority &mdash; tangible differences manifest in the culture. I think <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=colabcoop&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uJDSNc&text=Real%20magic%20happens%20when%20people%20realize%20they%20have%20true%20power%20in%20the%20organization.">real magic happens when people realize they have true power in the organization</a> and their voices carry weight.</p>

<p>I also think there's a powerful dynamic which emerges when you encourage rotating leadership. I've found the mantra, "No one should lead all the time and everyone should lead some of the time," to be really helpful. There's  compelling research on what power and privilege do to our individual psychologies. Personally, I've found it very liberating to be able to put down the burden of leadership and rejoice in being part of a network of peers.</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-21_1.jpg"></div>
<div class="overflow-hidden">
<p>I believe a collaborative organization is only possible when people have true power in an organization, put aside their professional masks, and bring all of themselves to work. When that happens, a deeply held sense of trust and love emerges in the community. This creates a low-friction environment for collaborating, which is an incredible competitive advantage. My sense is that <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=colabcoop&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uJDSNc&text=A%20lot%20of%20organizations%20waste%20inordinate%20amounts%20of%20energy.">a lot of organizations waste inordinate amounts of energy</a> on internal politics, bureaucracy, and power plays. These issues completely disappear in a collaborative organization.</p>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">What advice would you give to someone who wants to collaborate more effectively?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-21_1.jpg"></div>
<div class="overflow-hidden">
<p>I have a few pieces of advice:</p>

<p>First, focusing on decentralizing money, information, and control in your organization. When you find a nexus of centralization, apply gentle pressure until it slowly releases.</p>

<p>Second, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=colabcoop&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uJDSNc&text=Nurture%20a%20generous%20community%20by%20approaching%20every%20interaction%20asking%20what%20you%20can%20give.">nurture a generous community by approaching every interaction asking what you can give</a>, not what you can  get.</p>

<p>Lastly, realize that culture is everything. If you lost all of your money and assets but still had your culture you could build everything again. If you lose your culture, you will destroy anything you've created.</p>
