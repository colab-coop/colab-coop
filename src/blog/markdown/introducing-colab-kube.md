# Introducing CoLab-Kube, our alternative for hosted cloud servers

CoLab has been incrementally improving our DevOps systems for our clients for over a year by creating an accessible and more affordable dedicated server and computational cluster. This means that our IT team can better deploy, scale, manage, and host multiple numbers of applications.

We call it **CoLab-Kube** and it is based on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and other Open Source computational stacks to develop our systems to move many of our existing clients from AWS cloud systems, which are expensive for them.

Our motivation for creating our server cluster infrastructure is to explore how Kubernetes could help us develop independent systems that do not entirely rely on a single cloud computing provider in terms of costs and dependencies. As a worker-owned cooperative in the technology field, we consistently look for ways to create and improve our systems that can impact our members and clients and fulfill a spirit of cooperation for our community.

We are also making this transition as a matter of ethics because for far too long the only viable option of hosting our clientsâ€™ sites was on mega-corporate server infrastructure that does not serve workers or build justice. We are grateful to be able to offer something different that aligns with our [principles](https://colab.coop/values/).

We love making systems and tools that align with our cooperative values and provide a high-end, efficient, reliable IT infrastructure alternative for our clients and cooperative partners. Please stay tuned for more information and discussion around our reasoning and process. If you feel that your organization will benefit from a dedicated server and computational cluster systems technology, please connect with us at [friends@colab.coop](mailto:friends@colab.coop?subject=Interest%20in%20CoLab-Kube%20hosting).
