# Call to Action Buttons Are So 2015

We at CoLab like to find the best solutions for everyday problems.. And when it comes to call to action buttons, we just think they could be better. “Click here to try our product!” you get told every time you land on a page. “Please, pay attention to me!” they seem to say. Oh boy. Is this really the only way to get people to try something out?

We challenged ourselves to find a new thing. One which would make our button irresistible, so irresistible people would just have to press on it. 
 
What about this: imagine you don’t need to click on anything to see the software, because it’s just there, right in front of you. You want to know what it looks like? You already do. 

“Now that is something”, we thought. 

So we tried it recently for a longstanding client. We were redesigning marketing pages for a web app we built called Valuate, trying to get the most exposure for it as a property valuation and investment analysis software app. “As a small operation, we need to rise above the noise in the marketplace without the aid of a 7-figure marketing and advertising budget,” explains Bruce Kirsch, REFM founder and CEO. 

One of the beauties of Valuate is that anyone can create an account and start using its robust features for free. We wanted to ensure that as many people as possible could take advantage of it. For Bruce Kirsch, there was only one way: “the least expensive way to get noticed from a direct marketing costs perspective is simply to be remarkable.”

So we did what in retrospect is kind of a no brainer: we integrated the Valuate app onto the marketing pages. 

“Hold on!” you might say had you visited the site before. “The app was already embedded on the site. You didn’t invent anything!” And that would be, well, almost correct. What the Valuate marketing pages had before was a partial app embed. One could see some of the options, click on some buttons. Bruce describes it best: “with the partial app embed, we essentially took a Ginsu knife to the app and patched it back together, sacrificing some of the elegance and intuitiveness of the layout.”

What we changed was embedding the full app. The whole thing. Now, whenever anyone lands on the site, they are greeted with these words: “Go ahead. Try it out.” And that’s exactly what they can do, without any registration barrier. “The full app is uncompromised, it's the software as designed, displayed for users in all its glory,” confirms the CEO.

“Valuate is a remarkably powerful, fast and elegant software. Exposing it to site visitors in its full state, without requiring them to do any work, is our best way of setting up the possibility that visitors will see it, be impressed by it, and mention it to their contacts because it gives them social currency in so doing,” summarizes Bruce Kirsch. And he knows what he’s talking about: his business is thriving thanks to innovative ideas like this one.

Users no longer need to find their way through a labyrinth of pages before they can try the software out. Valuate finds better market awareness, many new user sign ups and, of course, new customers. A solid win all around.

”[The app integration on the marketing pages] showcases the software beautifully. Is it the first full web app embedded in a marketing page in the history of the Internet?” wonders Bruce Kirsch. “I’ve never seen anything like this.” 

We are not ones to brag and boast but since we create something that’s never been done in the history of the internet (not verified) ;), we thought we’d share. Revolutionary app embed? Check!
