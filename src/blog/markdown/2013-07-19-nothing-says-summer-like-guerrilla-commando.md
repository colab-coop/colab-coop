# Nothing says Summer like "Guerrilla Commando"

It’s summer and as much as we like to design, code, and create ... we also like to play. Ralph Cutler doing 80’s flavor better than [B-Fine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Force).

Shout out to our neighbor, [Petrune](http://petrune.annehj.com/), for playing host to our b-boy antics and for always having the freshest in local fashion.

And a shout out to the Full Force Crew for the inspiration.
