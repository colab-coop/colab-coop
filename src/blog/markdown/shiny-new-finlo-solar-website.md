# Just Launched: Shiny New Finlo Solar Website

<a href="http://www.finlosolar.com/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2013-02-08.png" class="center-element"></a>

[Finlo Solar’s new site](http://www.finlosolar.com/) is up, powered by sunshine and collaboration.

For Finlo, solar power is about possibilities. It’s about changing the way we think about energy.

For Rob Garity, owner of Finlo Solar, Solar isn’t just a lofty trend for the organic-eating, sustainable-brand-wearing, fossil-fuel-protesting do-gooders of the world. It’s a passion, an absolute love.

At Finlo, solar power is about possibilities. It’s about changing the way we think about energy. Much like how CoLab is about changing the way we do business. Here is a bright, talented, successful entrepreneur, who is open-minded and willing to invest in a strong web presence. And here we are, with the services to provide him this.

The more we got to know Rob, his approach to business and his vision, the more it became clear that we should collaborate, so we created a special team to execute a powerful solution for his business’s needs.

Together with [Art & Anthropology](http://www.artandanthropology.com/) on design and [Abigail Allen](http://abstractionsnyc.wordpress.com/) on brand and messaging, Colab developed the project on wordpress with a fun set of interactive features. [Explore](http://www.finlosolar.com/) for yourself, the possibilities.
