# Site Launched! California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute

<a href="//www.cpmcri-currents.org/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-05-23.jpg" class="center-element"></a>

<a href="//www.cpmcri-currents.org/">CPMCRI</a> is creating impact through important scientific research in the fight against global medical challenges like breast cancer and age-related diseases. They are part of the large non-profit health care organization [Sutter Health](//www.cpmc.org/).

CPMCRI came to CoLab for a modern communications platform that could free them from the restrictions of their existing web technology. Creating a fresh design and architecting a system on Drupal 7 to better organize massive amounts of content and showcase what they are working on. We are pleased to announce the site launch and our transition into a support and capacity building role with CPMCRI.

Side note: we love that the word collaboration is part of their primary navigation!

[See it live](//www.cpmcri-currents.org/). Big hearts to the team of [Douglas](//colab.coop/team), [Yaniv](//colab.coop/team), [Aaron](//colab.coop/team), [Jayme](//colab.coop/team), [Suman](//colab.coop/team), [Jess](//colab.coop/team), [Rylan](//colab.coop/team), [Ethan](//colab.coop/team), [Dejan](//colab.coop/team) and [Ralph](//colab.coop/team) for the design, delivery and support.
