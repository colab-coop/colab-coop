# Site Launched: Say Hello to thenextsystem.org

This week The Next System officially announced the relaunch of its website, [thenextsystem.org](https://thenextsystem.org)!  Over the last few months, the CoLab team worked with The Next System to redesign their digital home to make all the great papers, videos, and articles they produce easier to find and share. Our redesign is a ground up rethinking that is flexible, scalable and bold, elevating a platform authored by prominent thought leaders into an authoritative resource.

The content The Next System curates is deep, illuminating, striking at the core problems of western democracy and related global issues. It is worth exploring. Some of the great new content, includes [a powerful article](https://thenextsystem.org/learn/stories/after-storms-defeating-trumpism-rebuilding-america?mc_cid=3c052f74a1&mc_eid=58d0eaf6b4) by Next System Project co-chair Gar Alperovitz and his Democracy Collaborative co-founder Ted Howard, as well as [a new podcast episode](https://thenextsystem.org/learn/stories/episode-6-capital-bias-vs-generative-design-w-marjorie-kelly?mc_cid=3c052f74a1&mc_eid=58d0eaf6b4) with The Democracy Collaborative's Marjorie Kelly.

We want to especially thank The Next System team for taking the idea of collaboration to a new level. Weâ€™d also like to thank Radish Labs with whom we partnered in navigating a complex web of content.
