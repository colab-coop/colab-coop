# Food for the People: Boulder Food Rescue and Food Rescue Alliance crisis response

McKenzie Jones of CoLab Cooperative met with Lou Creech of the Boulder Food Rescue and Food Rescue Alliance to discuss their ability to ramp up food distribution amidst the COVID-19 crisis. What allows the food rescue movement to respond to todayâ€™s community food needs is what has always allowed them to respond: a decentralized culture of mutual aid and respect that is intended to serve communities from within. During this global pandemic, we can see which existing infrastructures can support the masses, and CoLab is happy to highlight these partners of ours who are doing great work now and always to do what is right for the people!
