# App Launched: GlassApp (New Art Museum, Too)

<a href="http://glassapp.cmog.org/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-03-24_2.png" class="center-element"></a>

The [Corning Museum of Glass](http://cmog.org/) opened their Contemporary Art + Design Wing this past Friday. The Contemporary Art + Design Wing is the largest space dedicated to contemporary glass anywhere in the world. In parallel with this historic event was the launch of [GlassApp](http://glassapp.cmog.org/), an app we designed and built with their digital team.

This is an exciting moment for the museum and an incredible achievement. We look forward to sharing more about our work with them soon. For now, we're still recovering from the grand opening party.
