# Warning, You Might Adopt a Great Habit After Reading

At CoLab we work a lot on giving. Giving is fundamental to our culture and our mission.  At our best, we personally ask ourselves everyday:  Who did I give to? What did I give? At minimum, we regularly ask CoLab as a business: When was our last pro bono design? What percentage of new contracts can we donate?

It is great to discover that other organizations are seeing this as a priority as well. The national campaign called [#GivingTuesday](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/11/marketing_without_a_master.html) began this year, dedicating an annual day of giving separate from any religious requirement. Taking place on November 27th on the heels of the day when the integrity of giving is at it’s most vulnerable, Black Friday.

CoLab’s contribution to this inspiring initiative, is a sharing application that powers a new give campaign aptly called [The Great Give](http://greatgive.us/). TGG’s humble beginnings started just a week earlier from #givingtuesday, via a [chance encounter](http://abstractionsnyc.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/what-happened-this-morning/) between an inspiring Brooklynite Joseph and CoLab’s esteemed collaborator / brand visionary Abigail Allen. From their classic NYC street story showing how kindness to others can provide the deepest level of wealth and happiness,  emerged the idea of asking people to document and share random or not so random acts of kindness and creating a central place for online for these acts to be collected for all to see. The Great Give was born.

The Great Give is a simple question, and a fun challenge. It asks:

> What Would Happen if You Gave Consciously for 30 Days and Encouraged Others to Do the Same?

There are a few simple rules, it takes next to no time to do each day and it costs as little as 30 smiles.

If you’ve gotten this far in the article, it’s kind of a sign that you should join the great give. Go ahead [here](http://greatgive.us/).

Shout outs to some extra special guest appearances by [Ethan Winn]() and [Jenn Schlick](), and from CoLab [Rylan Peery]() and [Jessica Peery](), who helped design and built and make the app a reality.
