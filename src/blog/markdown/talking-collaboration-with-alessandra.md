# Talking Collaboration with Alessandra

Alessandra is a designer at [Hassenstein Design](http://hassenstein.com/), a design firm in Brooklyn Heights, New York.

We talk to Alessandra about pre-production design process, exquisite corpses, and how designing a bug can prove a point.

## Tell us about Hassenstein Design and what you do there.

We're a pre-production company and design house. The majority of our work is pre-production for packaging. We work with artwork from in-house design teams. They'll create the design for the package and we'll work to fit it onto the packaging. That's most of what we do. The other part is small, local design stuff, anything from package design to web to branding.

I'm a junior designer. We all work on a job when it comes in. Our responsibilities are shared. I just have to check in with our senior designers to make sure I'm doing everything to spec, whether the client's or our own.

## How does collaboration fit into your daily work?

We divvy up the tasks. For the most part, everyone actually starts and finishes their own projects. Any collaboration is usually around logo design. We'll each spend a set amount of time working on our own designs, then we'll have a meeting, then we'll critique each other's work. Then go back to work on it, and come back together again after a set amount of time. We usually have meetings for these projects at the end of the day. It's nice because you can go home, think about it, and work on it the next day.

Because a lot of the work is so technical, it has to be checked multiple times. When I complete a design, I pass it to a senior designer to make sure it meets the specifications. My boss is usually the last person to glance over it. Then in the document slug you'll see "signed off," meaning the document has been checked. Then we'll send it off. There are checks to make sure there are no typos or mistakes on our side.

## What tools do you use to collaborate?

It's really in how we organize our files. Every time we make a change to a file, we make a copy. We have tons and tons of storage for multiple files of the same thing. It's something huge - like 24 terabytes - and that has to be backed up all the time.

You always put your initials at the end of the filename. In the document information, there is a specific box for the last person who opened the file to sign off. That way, there's accountability every step of the way.

Not only do we copy the file itself, we copy the entire folder. If we have four projects for a particular client, each folder gets duplicated. It's nice because you know the folder for the date - say, September 5th - is going to be the most recent version of every single document that's in there. Once you're sure, you can go back and delete the other ones. Which is a little scary sometimes. But we don't even have a trash, we have a "garbage" folder in case we need to go back!

## How does your company encourage a culture of collaboration?

We give immediate feedback. If you have a question, you just walk across the room. It's really laid back.

## Do you consider yourself a collaborative person by nature?

I do. I was actually thinking about that yesterday. "What do I know about collaboration? How does that differ from other people?" For me, it came from playing sports in college. Working on a team and learning not to take things personally, and learning how important it is to know the roles of the people you're working with. Maybe you can make their lives easier by doing something on your end.

I find that often people have trouble when there's a lack of communication or they communicate differently. You really have to put your own ego aside and make sure you have your priorities straight. Your work is going to get changed and moved around. You have to learn to just let it go. But that applies to any design work.

## Do you prefer to collaborate with diverse or like-minded teams?

Theoretically, it's better to work with a diverse team because you can examine all angles of the project.

Sometimes you see horrible ads in the subway and you like, "How did this get passed?" I assume everyone was thinking the same thing and no one in the room asked, "Wait a second, how does this make sense?" I think that happens when everyone is looking the same way and no one is stopping to examine it from another angle.

## Can you tell us about a recent successful collaboration?

Recently, my friend approached me to do a 3D exquisite corpse piece. If you've never done it before, exquisite corpse is a drawing game. You draw a face on a piece of paper. Then you fold the paper over so the next person can't see the face. Then somebody draws the torso. Then the legs. Then you unfold it and you have an "exquisite corpse."

In this show, everyone did a full figure. They were put together on a box to form a four-sided figure. You could turn the different parts to mix and match the figures.

That was a collaboration between four artists, but we all worked separately. We didn't see the final product until the end. In that case, I couldn't be married to how I wanted my piece to look, because three other people were involved in it, too.

At work, the last logo we did was really collaborative. We literally swapped design files. I would work on someone else's design and they would work on mine for awhile. Then we'd come back and review what we did. That was rewarding.

## Can you tell us about a recent collaboration challenge?

Different people say things and have different meanings. You have to understand how attached people are to their words.

Recently, we designed a logo for an extermination company. They didn't want to include a bug because a bug has a negative connotation. I ended up designing a logo that was a bug - but a cute, nonthreatening bug. Everyone thought it was great, but we couldn't show it to the client because they had said, "No bugs. Period." I was looking at the root of their request, but in the end we had to follow the request at face value.

## What advice would you give to others who want to collaborate more effectively?

For me, the biggest things are putting your ego aside, and making sure that you're understood. I think I'm terrible at communicating through writing, so sometimes I have to talk three times as long to get my point across. Sometimes I even ask the person, "Do you understand what I'm saying?"

When you're understood, you're not going way off in the wrong direction because of a miscommunication. You can understand what the person really needs. If it's an ongoing project, you're able to really think about how you can help that person in long run.
