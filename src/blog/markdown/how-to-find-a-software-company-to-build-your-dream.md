Whether it's your first time at the rodeo or you've been here before, finding a software company is one of most important parts of your project &mdash; if not the most important one.</p>

<p>Bruce Kirsch went through this process for the first time when he founded <a href="http://www.getrefm.com/">Real Estate Financial Modeling</a> and searched for a team to build the company's flagship product, <a href="http://www.getrefm.com/valuate/">Valuate</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout the following steps, Bruce shares thoughts about what it was like to find a software company.</p>

  Step I: Question yourself

<ul class="ul-unstyled text--small text--align-center">
  <li>Am I building a product or a marketing site?</li>
  <li>Do I need to work with my team in person?</li>

<div class="color-graylight-bg text--align-center">Am I building a product or a marketing site?</div>
<br>

<p>The difference is subtle. At the end of the day, sure, you're <a href="http://justbuildwebsites.com/">building a website</a>. But it's important to understand what kind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="color-graymedium">A product</span> is something people do something with, like Salesforce or Microsoft Office.</p>
<p><span class="color-graymedium">A marketing site</span> tells potential customers about your business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re building a business that involves people signing up for an account, you probably need a product. Otherwise, you probably only need a marketing site.</p>

<blockquote>
  If I rewind far enough, I had hired a web development firm. But it was to create a marketing website with ecommerce. That’s one thing &mdash; creating a software product is completely different. It’s a lot less intimidating to create a marketing site.

</blockquote>

<div class="color-graylight-bg text--align-center">Do I need to work with my team in person?</div>
<br>

<p>With the rise of distributed companies, your dream team could be spread across the globe. Consider:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=colabcoop&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uJDSNc&text=People%20can%20literally%20set%20their%20own%20salaries.">43% of the US workforce is expected to telecommute by 2016</a><br><span class="caption">[Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/US+Telecommuting+Forecast+2009+To+2016/fulltext/-/E-RES46635?objectid=RES46635), 2009</span></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=colabcoop&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uJDSNc&text=People%20can%20literally%20set%20their%20own%20salaries.">25% of global business leaders say more than three-quarters of their companies would not work in a traditional office by 2020</a><br><span class="caption">[Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/3034286/the-future-of-work/will-half-of-people-be-working-remotely-by-2020), 2014</span></p>

<p>Your project may have a physical component that requires regular in-person time. Chances are, though, it doesn't.</p>

<blockquote>
  It's made me a better communicator. It's made me understand the importance of communicating visually and having your message interpreted correctly. It’s one of the most important skills you can have. Otherwise, you might find out nine hours later that your team just spent time doing something that you didn't want them to do.

<div class="color-graylight-bg text--align-center">Can I handle the logistics?</div>
<br>

<p>Another way to think of this question: do you want to work with <span class="color-graymedium">a contractor</span> or <span class="color-graymedium">a team</span>?</p>

<p>The higher rate charged by teams comes with a number of perks: project managers, collaboration tools and access to senior strategists and engineers. The backstage guidance provided by senior leadership is an under appreciated &mdash; and undersold &mdash; bonus of working with a team.</p>

  Step 2: Find your people
</p>
<hr>
<ul class="ul-unstyled text--small text--align-center">
  <li>Who do I know who's done this before?</li>
  <li>Where are the experts?</li>
  <li>Have they done similar work?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</div>
</section>

<div class="container--text"><div class="styling-markdown blog-post-info">

<div class="spacing--lg-x"></div>

<div class="color-graylight-bg text--align-center">Who do I know who's done this before?</div>
<br>

<p>Referrals can be excellent filters for finding a team that's more likely to share your work style and values.</p>

<p>Harken back to the first set of questions about <span class="color-graymedium">product vs marketing site</span> and <span class="color-graymedium">contractor vs team</span>. Use your answers to frame how you ask your network for referrals.</p>

<blockquote>
Know any good web developers?
</blockquote>

Will get lots of referrals, but they might not be right for your project. A question with built-in filters might be:

<blockquote>
Know any development companies who've built a to-do app?
</blockquote>

<div class="color-graylight-bg text--align-center">Where are the experts?</div>
<br>

<p>In addition to tapping into referrals, look at industry publications to familiarize yourself with the big names. For design and development, these could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>[A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/)</li>
<li>[Boxes and Arrows](http://boxesandarrows.com/)</li>
<li>[Smashing Magazine](http://smashingmag.com/)</li>
<li>[The Web Ahead](http://thewebahead.net/)</li>
<li>[UX Booth](http://www.uxbooth.com/)</li>
<li>[UX Magazine](http://uxmag.com/)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also look at who's following and retweeting well-known agencies (E.G. <a href="https://twitter.com/lullabot">@lullabot</a>) and organizations (E.G. <a href="https://twitter.com/alistapart">@alistapart</a>).</p>

<div class="color-graylight-bg text--align-center">Have they done similar work?</div>
<br>

<p>One more time, loud and proud: <span class="color-graymedium">product</span> or <span class="color-graymedium">marketing site</span>? Look at the work of your potential people. It doesn't necessarily need to be the same animal, but it should be the same species.</p>

<p>This whole step &mdash; finding your people &mdash; takes time. It can take months. It can take multiple tries.</p>

<blockquote>
  It took three or four months. And I went through the process about a year before, so the second time I had an idea of what I wanted to see from people.

  Step 3: Talk to your people
</p>
<hr>
<ul class="ul-unstyled text--small text--align-center">
  <li>What's your process?</li>
  <li>Who will I work with?</li>
  <li>What do we need from each other to do our best work?</li>

<div class="spacing--lg-x"></div>

<div class="color-graylight-bg text--align-center">What's your process?</div>
<br>

<p>Before you sign a contract, your team to-be should be able to provide a high-level overview of their process or typical project phases.</p>

<p>As long as there IS a process, there's no wrong answer here.</p>

<div class="color-graylight-bg text--align-center">Who will I work with?</div>
<br>

<p>Some teams have a project manager who handles all communication. Some solo contractors will sub-contract your work to others. Talking about this upfront demystifies who will actually be doing the work.</p>

<div class="color-graylight-bg text--align-center">What do we need from each other to do our best work?</div>
<br>

<p>This is one of our go-to questions during a kickoff. It applies to team members and clients alike.</p>

<p>The beauty of this question: it opens a conversation about how you both really work &mdash; in contrast to a process document, which is often a best-case scenario.</p>

<blockquote>
  One of the biggest intimidations is not knowing the steps or process. That lack of understanding of, "How does it work? How long does this take?" That can be really scary.
