## Seventh Generation Homepage Features #ComeClean Campaign

We recently had the privilege of working with the rad team at Seventh Generation to help them launch their #ComeClean campaign.

Starring the inimitable Maya Rudolph and integrating television, social and web, the campaign calls on consumers to speak up in favor of home product companies being transparent about concerning toxins or chemicals in their products. You can read more about the campaign in [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/business/media/seventh-generation-taps-maya-rudolph-for-its-biggest-campaign-yet.html?_r=0) or check it out the commercials on [Adage](http://adage.com/article/media/maya-rudolph-real-seventh-generation-s-spot/303504/).

The work focused on revamping their homepage to feature quirky, humorous, full-width background video, a customized YouTube video player and updated product promotional blocks that include numerous lessons learned through analytics-driven insights. We worked with their Web director and design team to develop an optimized, responsive page that prioritized engagement with Seventh Generation’s mission, campaign message and products.

If you just can’t get enough responsive web design and Seventh Generation, you can also [see our previous work](https://colab.coop/blog/site-launched-seventh-generation-optimization/) with the company or listen to a [great podcast](http://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/seventh-generation/) we did with their team. :)
