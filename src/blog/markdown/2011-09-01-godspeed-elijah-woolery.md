# Godspeed Elijah Woolery

The only constant, is change, and a big change has come for our partner, collaborator and friend [Elijah Woolery](http://outofthedeepblue.com/WPsite/?page_id=2). He has been accepted to an extraordinary entrepreneurial program called the [Runway Project](http://www.runwayprogram.com/). It is a “pre-team, pre-idea venture creation program” which is funded through Eric Schmidt’s VC fund, Innovation Endeavors.

We are sending Eli extra heart bits as we will miss him in the day to day project flow. However, given the innovative nature of this program and Eli’s own boundless talent, we are excited to be there in a supportive role and watch as he and his team search, discover and prototype an idea that will serve a deep need in the world.

As we see Elijah off in this new and exciting opportunity, we are also grateful to be able to continue collaboration with his design company Out of the Deep Blue. Eli is handing over the Lead Designer role to his brother [Alex](http://outofthedeepblue.com/WPsite/?page_id=2) who has been sharpening his skills behind the scenes and ready to take the reins.

E we say this with the stingiest but sincerest of British accents, Godspeed my good man, godspeed!

Here’s the video Eli created for the program. It features Ubuntu Napa and Rammed Earth Works, two projects we collaborated on.
