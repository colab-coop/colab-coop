# Love The Youth

<img src="/assets/img/blog/2012-05-22_1.jpg" class="center-element">

CoLab hearts children.  We should know.  We only have like a bazillion of them amongst our members and collaborators.

So what better way to spend a Saturday than putting our creative talents to good use to nice up the local elementary school, [Beverly J. Martin](http://www.icsd.k12.ny.us/bjm/), with some fresh playground color courtesy of [Jessica Peery](http://colab.coop/team) and crew! (Big ups to [HomeDepot](http://www.homedepot.com/) for donating paint for both the playground and cafeteria mural two years running.)

Woot!

CoLab resident DJs were also in effect under some hot sunshine throwing down some old school playground jams for the summertime kickoff. Nothing quite like the sound of splattering drums bouncing off concrete while basketballs bounce and smack is talked in abundance.

Reports from the playground today indicate that the new four square court was particularly well received.
