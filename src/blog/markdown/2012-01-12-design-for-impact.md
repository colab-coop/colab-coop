# Design For Impact

We often ask ourselves, how can we help? How can we do more to contribute to community development, sustainable energy or the alleviation of suffering? Finding answers is getting a lot easier. Amazing platforms like [Catchafire.org](http://www.catchafire.org/) enable skilled professionals to find and link up with pro-bono [service opportunities](http://blog.catchafire.org/2011/08/18/find-your-cause-mission-markets/).

That opportunity was for a design project with [Mission Markets](http://www.missionmarkets.com/), a professional firm and social enterprise providing services around [impact investing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_investing).

The “Mission” for us, was to create a visual identity that conveys the organizations values and mission. As a financial services company, Mission Markets needed a symbol that was professional and clean. A reflection of their commitments to the triple bottom line. It also needed to be recognizable and translate to their anticipated hierarchy of subsidiary components. After a deep dive into documents the Mission Markets team had workshopped to determine their brand essence, we got to work. The result; a classic, iconic logo. Delivering a clear intent through it’s text driven shape.

Mission Markets is seeking to move the marketplace from a showcase of hard line profit numbers to a place where social and environmental impact is equally emphasized. Essentially transforming the dynamic of capital markets altogether. A challenging task no doubt, as traditional market exchanges are not so receptive to sustainable business models. So when we matched to work with them, we felt a deep responsibility to deliver and make it a positive investment for all.
