# Doing Good, Bears Fruit

<a href="http://prisonradio.org/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2012-02-02.jpg" class="center-element"></a>

It feels so damn good, to serve organizations like [Prison Radio](http://prisonradio.org/).  On January 30th Mumia Abu-Jamal hugged his wife for the first time in nearly thirty years. Incredible. Hearing of this news, truly warmed our hearts and reminded us once again, why we do all this technology and design for our clients and partners. We are contributing to better humanity and to a better planet.

Mumia is finally off of death row and out of solitary confinement. Getting Mumia off of death row took a herculean effort: An international campaign that included the delivery of over 5000 petitions, thousands of letters, and the threat of legal action. We did our small part through the design and build of a new, modern site to house Mumia’s years of radio essays and anchor the organizations tireless efforts. More details are available about Mumia’s transfer and his hug in this article by Noelle Hanrahan. Below is a quote from Mumia, thanking all those who helped in this tremendous event of goodness.

> My dear friends, brothers and sisters — I want to thank you for your real hard work and support. I am no longer on death row, no longer in the hole, I’m in population. This is only part one and I thank you all for the work you’ve done. But the struggle is for freedom!

> &mdash; From Mumia. Ona Move. Long Live John Africa!
