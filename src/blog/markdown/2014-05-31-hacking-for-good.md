# Hacking for Good

Though we are not officially participating in the official [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://www.hackforchange.org/), we are marching forward in a kindred spirit of improving lives and serving others with our 1st ever CoLab Hackathon.

It’s a unique Hackathon because we are doing it remotely from across the Globe; Slovenia, Canada, NYC, and a 16hr train across India to New Delhi.  HipChat and Hangouts are our glue.

Helping families grappling with the challenges of aging and death is our fire.

Speaking of fire, we’ve wiped the slate clean for this hack session. Formerly known as Storied, we have rebranded the app Reflect. We also started with a fresh pitch and storyboard, along with a robust API to back our ideas. Embracing lean/agile methods by focusing on users’ needs, personas and rapid iteration. Out of that greenfield, we are carrying the app into the wearables age with a Glass component for integrating intimate moments into our rich tapestry thanks to our partners at [Brierwood Cooperative](http://www.brierwoodapps.com/). Together our sights are set on getting something out the door quick for feedback and refinement.

Here’s our pitch for the app!

> It keeps you awake at night: the doctors, the treatments, the uncertainty.  Alzheimer’s is a terrifying disease for both of you. All you want is to help your aging mother to be happy through this challenging time.

> Reflect guides you in the process of creating a living “life portrait” for your mother or father, one that will provide them with hours of peace and joy as they live out their remaining years.

> Reflect is there even when you are not able to be—your mother can reach for it whenever she is feeling anxious or disoriented, and be reminded of the things she loves the most: her treasured childhood memories, music she listened to when she was young, and messages from her beloved family members.

> Best of all, Reflect helps you to keep adding to your family biography as a living tapestry of life moments. New stories, messages, interviews, and videos can be added over time, gifting your mother with the joy of discovery and connection into her sunset days.

> Reflect also guides you in the process of keeping your mother’s memory alive, interviewing her and putting her own and others’ stories right back into the portrait. Designed with valuable tips from professional biographers and gerontology researchers, Reflect shows you the best ways to put your mother at ease, and the best questions to ask to document her most vital stories.

> What results over time is a living, fully realized story of your mother’s life that she will love while she is alive, and that you, your children, and their children can continue to cherish even when she is gone.

We can’t wait to share the fruits of our labor with you.
