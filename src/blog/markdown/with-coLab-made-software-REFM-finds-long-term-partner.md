# With CoLab Made Software REFM Finds Long-term Partner 

Our partner Real Estate Financial Modeling (REFM) has entered into a long-term software license agreement with Realtors Property Resource® (RPR®), an online property database available exclusively to members of the National Association of REALTORS®, one of the largest trade organization in the U.S.

We designed and built REFM’s Valuate® investment analysis software and will be supporting  the integration with RPR’s database of more than 160 million U.S. property records. The system will aid REALTORS® in performing quick, detailed investment projection analyses on both residential and commercial properties.

“RPR is very pleased to be able to offer Valuate® as a member benefit to more than one million REALTOR® members.  Valuate® will provide RPR with an advanced set of investment analysis tools as part of its overall value proposition”, said RPR CEO Dale Ross.

“Valuate® will serve RPR users well by allowing them to run sophisticated financial analyses instantly and present the results with confidence to their clients”, said REFM Founder Bruce Kirsch.
