# Social Enterprise Re-Launched: Rice Field is Deep on Substance, Fresh with Style

After a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign this past Spring, [Rice Field Collective](http://www.ricefield.co/) has launched their freshly redesigned storytelling e-commerce shop. This launch marks another leap forward in their ascent as a modern, eco-friendly and socially conscious knitwear brand. The site features the ability to showcase not only the beautiful hand-knit products but also the makers, designers, and other collaborators who all play a role in the story of each product.

We are proud of this project due to the positive impact Rice Field’s business model has in empowering women in Philippines and in helping them [preserve their ancestral lands](http://ricefield.co/world/#preserving-a-way-of-life). For CoLab, this project represents a text-book example of the power of social enterprise and why we are such strong believers in the idea that business can drive meaningful social change in the world.

What is more, this project is an excellent example of CoLab’s unique collaborative approach to business development.  Founder Meredith Talusan’s shared passion for collaboration and keen creative abilities allowed us to work together on the design of the project.  We leveraged Meredith’s keen design eye, photographic genius, interaction design insight and all around creative chops to work collectively in the design of the site’s overall experience.  This is a collaborative process we hope to continue leveraging as the company grows and evolves their online presence, and one which we think will serve as a case study for future clients to learn from.

Shout outs needed for our CoLab team as well in their heroic effort to get the site completed under an aggressive launch timeline. [Jayme](http://colab.coop/team), [Steve](http://colab.coop/team), [Cris](http://colab.coop/team), [Rylan](http://colab.coop/team), [Brian](http://colab.coop/team), [Suman](http://colab.coop/team) and myself ([Ralph](http://colab.coop/team)) all poured our heart and soul into this beautiful piece of work.
