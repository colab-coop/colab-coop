# Site Launched: Seventh Generation Optimization

<a href="//seventhgeneration.com/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/seventh-generation-mobile-update.jpg" alt="google mobilegeddon graphic" class="center-element border-all"></a>

This week, with CoLab’s collaboration, <a href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com/" target="_blank">Seventh Generation</a> launched their newly redesigned and revamped site with a focus on mobile and story-telling. We brought together Drupalistas (slang for people really good at Drupal) from around the world and collaborated with Seventh Generation’s internal managers, designers and technology team to make it all happen.

Our work focused on making their site mobile in time for <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-mobile-friendly-algorithm-a-week-later-was-it-really-mobilegeddon-219893" target="_blank">Google’s recent mobilegeddon</a> initiative, in addition to a bunch of optimization towards faster performance and easier content administration.

Seventh Generation is blessed with and amazing web team and we are proud to be supporting their efforts. Amazing doesn’t just mean talented either, it means genuine and passionate about making the world a brighter place. One good example is there status as a certified <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/community/seventh-generation" target="_blank">B Corporation</a> for neary 10 years. Another is their ongoing work to <a href="https://fighttoxins.com/" target="_blank">protect children from exposure to toxic chemicals</a> by supporting sound state and federal toxic chemical policy.
