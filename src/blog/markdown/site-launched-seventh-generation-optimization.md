# Site Launched: Seventh Generation Optimization

<a href="//seventhgeneration.com/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/seventh-generation-mobile-update.jpg" alt="seventhgeneration.com homepage" class="center-element border-all"></a>

This week, with CoLab’s collaboration, <a href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com/" target="_blank">Seventh Generation</a> launched their newly redesigned and revamped site with a focus on mobile and story-telling. We brought together Drupalista’s (slang for people really good at Drupal) from around the world and collaborated with Seventh Gen’s internal managers, designers and technology team to make it all happen.

Our work focused on making their site mobile in time for <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-mobile-friendly-algorithm-a-week-later-was-it-really-mobilegeddon-219893" target="_blank">Google’s recent mobilegeddon</a> initiative and also to do a bunch of optimization towards faster performance and easier content administering.

Seventh Generation is blessed with and amazing web team and we are proud to be supporting their efforts.Amazing doesn’t just mean talented either, it means genuine and passionate about making the world a brighter place. A good example is the work have been doing for years to <a href="https://fighttoxins.com/" target="_blank">protect children from exposure to toxic chemicals by supporting sound state and federal toxic chemical policy.
