# Modern Web Approach To Ancient Yoga Studies

[The Yoga Studies Institute](http://www.yogastudiesinstitue.org/) (YSI) is a school that teaches how to achieve the ultimate goal of yoga: a life of love, wisdom, authenticity, fulfillment and purpose. It teaches yoga as a lifestyle in a modern sense. Helping to connect the ultimate or enlightened self with your everyday self.

Sound pretty awesome? It is very awesome and deeply powerful. So when their team approached us about redesigning their website, we felt tremendous gratitude. Time to roll up our sleeves and master the art and code of joyful work! Actually, we just launched the site. Time to celebrate in our joyful work!

> Late in Gandhi’s life a Western journalist asked, ‘Mr. Gandhi, you’ve been working fifteen hours a day for fifty years. Don’t you ever feel like taking a few weeks off and going for a vacation?’ Gandhi laughed and said, ‘Why? I am always on vacation.’

> Because he had no personal irons in the fire, no selfish concerns involved in his work, there was no conflict in his mind to drain his energy. He had just one overwhelming desire — an ambition that, like a bonfire, had consumed all his passion.

Even joyful projects are not with out it’s challenges. In fact many of the best ones are full of them. With YSI we faced challenges both with look and flow as well as technical.

How do you visualize and experience the intersection of modern life with ancient wisdom on the web? Can you convey how YSI is re-defining yoga with training for both inner and outer practice? Our humble discoveries can be found here.

Technically YSI needed to be able two searchable databases. One of teachers worldwide and one of media from various events, live and correspondence courses. They also needed infrastructure to support their eLearning courses and organize their deep curriculum. The answer was a custom, yoga specific CMS with media library.  You can’t see with out special access, but poke around a bit, you’ll feel the love we put in there.

YSI strives to empower individuals with the ability to benefit all people. To give more, love more, be better. We look forward to a long and ongoing relationship with YSI and thank them providing us a means to be in service and to grow,  both in our web craft and as humans.
