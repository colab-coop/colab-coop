# App Launch: REFM Enters Closed Beta

A massive and exciting project we have been working on this year came out from behind the curtain this week. Entrepreneur, partner and collaborator [Bruce Kirsch](http://www.getrefm.com/about-real-estate-financial-modeling-page-4) has launched [Valuate by REFM](http://www.getrefm.com/), a next-generation commercial real estate financial analysis and property marketing software platform. Read the full announcement for this game changing app below, posted via the REFM blog:

> Valuate by REFM, the next-generation commercial real estate financial analysis and property marketing software platform, officially entered closed Beta testing today. The much-anticipated web browser- and cloud-based application has nearly 700 eager testers signed up for the open Beta, which is scheduled to commence on Monday, October 14th.

> Valuate is currently being tested by an invitation-only group of commercial real estate professionals that work at the highest levels of the business across asset classes and geographies. This group has been instrumental in shaping the functionality and feature set of the application, starting with user interviews as early as October 2012.

> ”This is a terrific day for REFM, its amazing technology partner Colab Coop, and all of REFM’s 7,000-plus community members,” said REFM founder and president Bruce Kirsch. ”We are grateful to be at this milestone and eager to reveal Valuate to the world in mid-October. It will be well worth the wait for those who are not participating in the private Beta release.”

> Mr. Kirsch added, ”Valuate has been built to enterprise-grade specifications for top practitioners in the real estate business who demand that their software tools keep pace with their workflow.”
