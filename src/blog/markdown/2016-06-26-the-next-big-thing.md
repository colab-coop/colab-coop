## DRAFT The next big thing in tech 

Okay, I'l be honest, the title might be a little misleading. I don't know what the next big thing in technology is. I do however know what it should be. 

Now right there, I am contradicting myself, going against the "thing" I am about to share with you. In my understading or the world, it is counter productive to tell someone or some group of people what they should do, unless of course they ask you to.

It's okay though, I think, I am part of the tech and start up cutlure iand therefore can be counted as part of the group that should do what I'm about to say. You know what though, I'm going to raise the priority right here and now from should to need.

Chat bots, buying up social media platforms, or the growth of exsiting ones 
hanging our strategic hats on making teams less busy or boosting productivity or curated experiences based on behaviors and interest.

You know what fuck that. What we need to be doing is building tools that actually help people learn and grow as communicators. 

I stand in a particular world veiw, my facebook feed is filled with memes and comments casting stones, speaking in a tone, even if friendly and rooted in love and for the benefit of all. We are not listening. and as sudies show people are much more brave, volital, hide behind the safety of anamyinty.
