# Partnership Gets it Done; Stop The Pity Goes Live

<a href="http://www.stopthepity.org/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2013-10-28.png" class="center-element"></a>

A second site launched this week, [StopThePity.org](http://www.stopthepity.org/), bringing together a great CoLab team; [David](http://colab.coop/team), [Jenn](http://colab.coop/team), [Rylan](http://colab.coop/team), [Ethan](http://colab.coop/team), [Suman](http://colab.coop/team) and [Peter](http://colab.coop/team).

The project came to us by way of [ReAllocate.org](http://reallocate.org/) and we jumped at the chance to fulfill the giveback opportunity. The site was nearing completion when we got it, but needed a strong team to close it out and give it some needed mobile optimization love.

Stop the Pity refers to themselves as a movement that tells a new story about poverty. A story about potential &mdash; the potential that every person has, regardless of circumstance, to create an amazing life for themselves and their community. Is that powerful or what?

This past weekend the project was showcased as an official partner of the [Life is Beautiful Festival](http://www.lifeisbeautifulfestival.com/) along side some large organizations like Charity Water. It took a strong push to get it completed for the festival, but we worked it out. We hope the resulting site will Stop The Pity spread word of the great work it is doing and encourage many more to [support](http://thevanityproject.org/collections/stop-the-pity) and join the movement.

It shouldnâ€™t go with out mention the other do gooders who partnered to bring the project together: [Mama Hope](http://www.mamahope.org/), [ReAllocate](http://www.reallocate.org/), [Hope Phones](http://hopephones.org/), [Architecture for Humanity](http://architectureforhumanity.org/), [Journey of Action](http://www.journeyofaction.com/), [RYOT](http://www.ryot.org/), [CTC International](http://www.ctcinternational.org/), and [The Adventure Project](http://theadventureproject.org/).
