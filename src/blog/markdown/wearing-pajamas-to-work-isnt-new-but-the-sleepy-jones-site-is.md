# Wearing Pajamas To Work Isn't New, But The Sleepy Jones Site Is

<a href="http://sleepyjones.com/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2013-04-18.png" class="center-element"></a>

Recently, our friends at [Hugo + Marie](http://www.hugoandmarie.com/) returned to us with a new collaboration project to build a custom ecommerce solution for a new clothing label.

The freshly launched [Sleepy Jones](http://sleepyjones.com/) store is the brainchild of Andy Spade, of Partners in Spade, who helped to create the Kate Spade and Jack Spade lines of accessories for women and men. The loungewear company was hatched with the idea of creating comfortable clothes for creative people.

“Plimpton was known to roam the Paris Review office in boxers. Picasso churned out masterpieces in little more than shorts and a robe. They weren’t projecting themselves as businessmen or union workers. They were being their authentic, comfortable selves &mdash; and the comfort of being yourself is true style,” the site’s About Us section declares.

While clicking through the pages of Sleepy Jones, if you’re not already in your underwear, you’ll be inspired to shuck your outer layers and be comfortable. Then click through the site more and order cuter comfortable loungewear for “reading, writing, painting, pondering and playing,” in.

The [NYTimes Magazine](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/sleepy-jones-ready-for-copy/) wrote up a nice piece to herald the launch.

CoLab provided a mobile responsive implementation of the website design as well as content management training and launch support.
