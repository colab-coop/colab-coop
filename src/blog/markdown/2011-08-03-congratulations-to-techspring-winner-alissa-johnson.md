# A Special Congratulations to TechSpring Winner Alissa Johnson!

[Collaboration](http://colab.coop) being the very heart and soul of our company. CoLab is proud to be participating in the innovative TechSpring program with the [Unreasonable Institute](http://unreasonableinstitute.org/profile/ajohnson/) and [Singlebrook Technology](http://www.singlebrook.com/connect/blog/techspringtba).

We are thrilled for Institute Fellow [Alissa Johnson](http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/32657-Singlebrook-Technology-and-Unreasonable-Institute-Announce-Alissa-Johnson-CalSolAgua-as-TechSpring-Winner) and her organization CalSolAqua. We are also excited to be working as part of a tremendous team of creative technology and marketing companies to help CalSolAqua effect positive social and environmental change.

Alissa and her team have developed a clean and inexpensive solar water heating system capable of addressing the hot water needs for bathing and laundry; one of the highest energy needs facing global households. Retailing at only $150, the system reduces household energy costs plus provides health benefits to households currently relying on fossil fuel generation.

I big hug and shout out to Elisa Miller-Out at [Singlebrook](http://singlebrook.com/) for spearheading the project!
