# Talking Collaboration with Mikael

<img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_2.jpg" class="center-element" alt="Mikael from Crew">

<em>This post is part of an ongoing series about collaboration in the workplace. We talk to individuals about their challenges, successes, and advice on how to collaborate more effectively.</em>

Mikael Cho is the founder of [Crew](http://wwww.pickcrew.com/), a community that connects designers and developers with projects. We talk to Mikael about building [Moodboard](http://www.gomoodboard.com/) and [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com/), hiring the right people, and reusing internal documents to help others.

<p>I'm the founder of Crew. Crew is a community of independent, pre-vetted designers and developers. We have a network of 400 designers and developers now. We connect them with projects - also pre-vetted. Everything is done through Crew, from project management to payments.</p>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">Your site has gone through a lot of upgrades recently.</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>Yeah, there's a lot of changes we've done. The way that we typically do it, we'll do something manually first, to the point where we can't do it anymore, then we build the technology over it.</p>

<p>Then when you do actually build it, you build what you need to build. You don't build too much and you build the right things. You have a better intuition about what you should be building.</p>

</div>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">How does collaboration fit into your daily work?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>We have an office, but a third of our team is remote. We use our office more as as escape place. You have a desk there, you have a computer, but you don't necessarily have to be there to do your work. We found that &mdash; and I've written about this in the past &mdash; optimizing your creativity and helping you feel good when you're working, to establish a state of flow. Sometimes that doesn't happen in an office, when there are a lot of people around. Finding that flow, wherever that is for you, we want to encourage that.</p>

<p>Collaboration, for us, happens where, we'll typically have a lot of individual thought amongst our team. Then we'll come together &mdash; and this is usually done on a weekly basis &mdash; somebody will have an idea for something, and that's when we meet and discuss things. Then everybody goes away again. You're allowed to think about that idea a bit further, go down your own tracks, then you come back together again. The benefit of doing that, it distributes the creative stress. Instead of putting it all on one person or expecting one person each meeting to come up with something, you have it on everyone, and everyone is thinking about it at different levels. You don't cloud other people's perspectives because you're only being creative in a meeting. We like to have that time to individual thought, then a meeting, then individual thought. It allows us to explore a lot of different possibilities.

To do that, we do some things in person, then some people arne't there, so we'll Skype them in. We also use HipChat. It's like a town hall, it's nice to have it there. You feel connected wherever you are. That's the day-to-day in how we're running everything

</div>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">What other tools do you use to collaborate?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>Besides Skype and HipChat, we use Cloud. That is a product where you take screenshots and share them with links. It's really simple because when you're sending things back and forth all the time, you want to visually show someone something instead of saying it. It's one of the quickest ways I've seen to take a quick screenshot, throw it in, send a link. It works every time. We reference that without having to scrol up and down through conversations.</p>

We just started using Meldium. It's a little plugin that saves all of your passwords. It's not as heavy as 1password, or something where things get crossed, like your personal accounts and your company accounts. It just pops into Chrome. Whether you're on your personal Twitter or company Twitter, once you switch the account, it just reads the page as the new logged in account. It's a really seamless way of doing it.

Trello is another big one. Trello is the way that we manage all of our projects. We've got this massive Trello board and we're able to assign things. Since we have a lot of things doing on, the way Trello organizes different tasks is really helpful. I've found Trello really useful when you have more than five projects running at once.

We actually don't use email that much. Between my teammates, there's maybe one email a week that I may be exchanging with someone, or they might be exchanging with me.

</div>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">Does your team document these conventions?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>We use a combination of Google Docs and a wiki. That wiki will store all of the information. We've been working on it a lot, now that we're growing. We were a team of four when we started. Now we're 15. How do you transfer all of that knowledge to people that are joining the team? While giving the freedom for them to iterate and make it even better.</p>

Anything that's set in stone, we'll put that in the wiki. It's harder to change and you can't track changes. Things that we want to be fluid, we'll create Google Docs for them. The whole team will be invited to those and have edit access. At any point, those can be updated and we can improve on them. What we look to do, is put those documents public. We have a section on Crew called Backstage. That's where we share things that we've figured out that we think may be useful for other people or companies. One thing we're looking to do soon, we've got a whole process for how we share content we create. We've been looking at the best way to do that, and we have a Google doc that we've been working on. We've got it to a point where it's been honed pretty well. It's been worked over and over and over, so we want to show that process to other people. We think that will be really useful.

We'll collaborate on it, and if there's something useful there for other people, we'll put it public. Then it becomes a reference for us. So for new people, we might show them these public posts as well as the Google doc.

</div>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">How do your team manage working across different timezones?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>Nobody works set hours. Everyone at Crew has different hours, even people that are based here in Montreal. I'm all over the place. Sometimes I'll start really early, sometimes I'll start later, like 11AM. Some of my teammates will start 2PM, some will start at 5PM and work into the night. Then we have people in Finland who work at different times.

If there's a deadline approaching where we need to cross paths, we'll plan that out a week ahead of time. We'll say, "We're probably going to be around each other for this time period." Let's say it's 10AM to 2PM. But the rest is up to you. That can be set up by you, and that's the majority of the time. We found that if you hire the right people and you have the right team, people will look to optimize their time. They'll look to find ways to do things better, when you give them the freedom to figure that out. That's been a really useful thing. People's energy levels are different at different times and I don't want to mess with that at all. From the research that I've done &mdash; and I've written a few posts on this (Ed. note: <a href=""></a>) &mdash; for creativity to exist, you need your engine to be running optimally. We don't all have the same cycles. We don't all feel the same at 3PM when that meeting happens. By predetermining something to happen all the time... sometimes it can be useful if it's short and it's clear what's happening. But what we've seen most of the time is spontaneous meeting where someone's figured something out and they have an insight and we're going to talk about it, that's the better way to set up a meeting. Rather than putting a meeting every single day to do this, then you show up and it feels a bit dry and the ideas aren't as good. We have a mishmash.</p>

</div>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">It sounds like you have a good set of internal tools at Crew. Do you have any plans to release your tools to the public?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>Yeah, definitely. Our content distribution is a great example. We're repeating it so often, that requires a tool, and we may actually build something. Anything we repeat a lot, we consider if it would be worthwhile to build it. Those are the points that we look for. Sometimes a Google doc is good enough. But if there's a process that has 30 different steps. For example, our distribution plan when we create an article on our blog. There's a MailChimp newsletter, it goes to three different campaigns at different times. Tweets need to be lined up with different headlines. Facebook and LinkedIn have different things. But there's a formula behind it. For Facebook, we need to make sure that we have a photo and this. For LinkedIn, we need the link and something else. Figuring out what that formula is, since we do it so often. We write about 15 posts a month, so when we're doing that over and over, we can make that into a one minute or automatic process, we'll save a lot of time. Right now, that distribution might take an hour or two to set up, per post.</p>

For us, content is the main way that we've been growing and what we're trying to give away. We try to provide a lot of value and create things. We've been doing it over and over and over. We just try to refine those processes. Can we go from doing 10 great articles to 20 great articles, or even 100 great articles, per month? We don't want to dilute our content, but we want it to be great. If we can do that more often, more efficiently, we'll improve our process and potentially build a tool behind it.

Moodboard, for instance, was a tool that we made. It came from our effort to help people posting projects on Crew. We would ask them for sites and images that inspired them. We'd get different files, folders of images, PDFs. We were trying to figure out, "How do we know what people liked from each image? How can we make this easier?" We were doing this on every project. We said, "Ok, let's make a tool where we can give that to somebody. They can just drop in images. You don't even have to make an account. You can just share that link. Then all the images are there and what you like about each thing is there. That became a really useful tool. That made everything more efficient. It's something we're considering building into Crew now. When you post a project that's design-focused, you can drop in a few things and it uses the same technology from Moodboard.

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">Do you consider yourself a collaborative person by nature?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>Yeah, I do. I played sports since I was four or five years old. One of the things I always enjoyed was constructing the right play. For instance, my greatest joy was not necessarily scoring a goal in soccer. It was being a part of a great play. I might contribute a pass and it just flows and becomes this thing that is perfect. I always thought of that, if you relate that back to your question, I'd much rather be part of a play with a bunch of people and it turns out perfect, then take it all the way and score the goal.</p>

I heard something interesting the other day. Two basketball players, Bill Russell and Will Chamberlain, both hall of famers. Will Chamberlain would score four times the amount as Bill Russell. You would think everyone would want to play with him. But actually, everyone wanted to play with Bill Russell. He won more championships than anyone in that era. He won more championships and Will Chamberlain had more points, but everyone wanted to be Bill Russell's teammate. I think that's a similar comparison.

</div>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">Have you seen a collaboration recently that inspired you?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>The biggest one that's inspired me was a tool that we made called Unsplash. Unsplash is a photo community. We give away 10 free photos every 10 days, and you can do whatever you want with them. They're all high quality. We started the site about 16 months ago. We had these extra photos when we were designing our website. We said, "Let's give these away for free. There aren't a lot of good stock photos out there, and they're really expensive. We'll just make them free and they'll all be good. We put them up and called it, "10 photos every 10 days," because we had 10 photos. We didn't know how we would get the next 10. So we added a form to submit a photo, and we figured we could take some ourselves if we needed to.</p>

In the first month, there were 20,000 downloads, just for those 10 photos. Then people started submitting. This was crazy to me. All of these photos are free, so people aren't financially benefitting from this at all. There's just a sense of goodwill in it. It just keep going. Now we're doing 2.4 million downloads per month, and over 165 million photos are viewed every month.

It's fully community generated. There's people submitting photos, there's people queueing photos and selecting the 10 every 10 days. People are building things using these photos and it's inspiring another level of creativity. There's a hashtag on Instagram, #unsplash, and people are creating art, combining photos, and doing crazy things with them. They're giving credit back to the photographers. There's a lot of goodwill that exists in people. When they see you do a bit of it, and you give something for free, they want to be a part of that. It changes the dynamic.

I knew that could happen &mdash; you see it with Wikipedia &mdash; but to see it happening with something that you made is unreal.

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">Where have you seen collaboration break down, and what lessons were learned?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>I'e seen quite a few. When you're entire company is a collaboration site, you want to give timely feedback at the right time, and you want to say what you mean. However, especially when communicating digitally, people don't have any cues. The person who's receiving what you're saying, especially if they don't know you that well, or they've never met you in person, you have to be very careful with how you present the information. It's almost like teaching someone who hasn't learned addition before. It looks really easy to you, because you're the teacher, but they don't necessarily see what you've seen throughout your career. You have to bridge that gap and teach them in a way that doesn't make them feel stupid. There's a similar way that I've seen collaboration go wrong, especially when it's digital. If something comes off as offensive just because of the way the sentence is structured, those are little things that can mean a lot. When you're sending digital messages, we don't have our external senses, and we can only read the words that others are writing.</p>

When you're collaborating, how you write has the biggest impact. For example, starting sentences with "I feel" versus making commands. "I feel this color should be blue," instead of, "This color must be blue!" They all add up. People can make it work in the beginning, but if there's a little bit of friction, it adds up over time until somebody can break. That's where I've seen the biggest breakdown. How you work and how you write back and forth.

The one thing people want when designing a website is, "clean and simple." I think everybody wants that. But the versions of "clean and simple" are different. We have to ask people for examples of sites that they find "clean and simple." I think clean and simple might look like Apple's site. They might think clean and simple looks like Toys r Us site. The designer might think something completely different. That is a very common use case. The clean and simple example. Pictures speak a lot. If we can get a collection of images to break down what they think is "clean and simple," that gives the designer a good idea of what the client feels is "clean and simple." Just knowing what each side is expecting can help the communication.

</div>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">What are some interesting differences you've come across between centralized and decentralized/collaborative organizations?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>In a hierarchical organization, I've seen that things can go slow and people don't feel empowered. You feel like you can't do anything. You get discouraged from doing things, so you stop doing things, and only do things that are given to you. That's the biggest difference that I've seen. The ability to move faster when the structure is flat. You can explore without the fear that it's wrong or you'll get in trouble or you need approval. Sometimes being able to do those other things helps you in doing your jobs. Reading a blog post might be considered wasted time. However, maybe you go back to your design job and you remember, "I read that thing, I liked how that was structured, maybe that can impact my design somehow. Or even the design of the blog could impact your design. That creation and consumption is necessary. There are companies that block Twitter and Facebook, and I think it makes people feel small. That hurts creativity.</p>

</div>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">What practices do you feel are most important for an organization to encourage a culture of collaboration?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>Trust. Trust will fuel everything. Trust will fuel people saying what they actually think. It won't make them afraid to give opinions, and that's what moves everything forward. Trust is also what will let people work their own hours and figure out what needs to be done. To make people feel trust is the ongoing challenge of every company. To make people feel that you trust them. There are lots of things you can do to make that happen, but you have to trust the people that you're hiring.</p>

For instance, not having set hours. What does that say to a person? When we were kids, we didn't have set hours for things. We just did the things that we liked. If you're hiring someone who enjoys their work, and if they say they enjoy their work, by giving them the freedom to work when they want to, they'll probably work even more and do better work than if you told them to work from x time to x time, because that's the time you want to be working. That's one example. Another example is giving people the tools. Another thing we do at Crew is we'll say, "What's the setup you need? What hardware do you need to do the things that you want to do?" Different people want different software. Just that feeling that, you're giving me the tools and setup for me to do the best, that makes me want to do my best. That is also a trust factor. Anything you can do to build that trust, it's just like a relationship. Building that up, so when you collaborate, that barrier has been reduced. That's also why we share a lot of this on Backstage and why we have HipChat. Everyone talks openly about things, because that also adds to trust. When everyone is open, that changes everything.

</div>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">Do you prefer to collaborate with diverse or like-minded teams?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>I prefer a little bit of clash. For example, I prefer Montreal as a city. I've been to a lot of bigger, or tech-focused cities, more advantageous cities to be in for business. Everytime I come back to Montreal, there's a balance, things that I don't see in those other places. I spent time in Silicon Valley in San Francisco. But every time I came back to Montreal, there's a really good mix. Tech isn't too far, some people know certain things, and you can tap into that. It gives you a different perspective. I really enjoy that. When you bring that into a team, and you have a team from diverse backgrounds, you can come up with totally different concoctions, because you're not all on the same train of thought. You're not all reading the same things. I think that's super important. Anything you can do to be influenced by something that's a bit different than what you see as true, that increases the chances for different ideas-cocktails to happen. You can come up with something that no one has come up with before. Everything that you've done in your life is different that somebody else's. Nobody has what you have. Automatically, you bring something different than somebody else. That is really important. Letting people feel that they can share those things. As we've seen time and again, everything changes all the time. The world is too dynamic. Certain things might work one year, then the next year, those are not the things to do things anymore. In web design, it was, "Keep everything above the fold," and then, "The fold doesn't matter anymore." I think it comes down to making good stuff and feeling the emotional impact of things. The only way you can get that is feeding off different perspectives and seeing different opinions.</p>

</div>

<p class="lubalin-bold text--large"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2014-12-27_3.png" class="float-left margin-right-base-lg">What advice would you give to someone who wants to collaborate more effectively?</p>

<div class="float-left margin-right-base-lg margin-top-base"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2015-01-25_1.jpg"></div>

<div class="overflow-hidden">

<p>I'm reading Creativity Inc from Ed Catmull, one of the founders of Pixar. He had a quote, "What someone is capable of doing tomorrow is more important than what they can do today."</p>

The way you give your input and feedback. When I first started in design, I was super direct. But it often didn't go over well. I thought people could read between the lines of my digital message, but they couldn't. That was partly my fault. I see that a lot.

The thing that you want to encourage with your feedback. Maybe the design right now isn't that great. But your job, by giving feedback, is to make them want to re-think it and do it tomorrow. If you say something negative, is that going to make them want to do it tomorrow? Probably not. But if you can frame it as more of a challenge, "I'm feeling this is not the right direction to have a large impact. Do you want this to be impactful?" Making it clear that we're in this together. The way you give feedback should be to get people to want to do it tomorrow, to want to work on it and make it better tomorrow.
