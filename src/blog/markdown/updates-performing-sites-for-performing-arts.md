# Updates: Performing Sites for Performing Arts

We are pleased to be serving the arts in our recent work with [HowlRound](http://www.howlround.com/), a Center for the Theater Commons at Emerson College.

CoLab has begun helping Howlround make users count by tracking and improving the community experience through SEO and analytics.

We love how their collaborative spirit echo’s our own both in purpose and approach. HowlRound is an online theater journal and knowledge base. They operate in close collaboration with Emerson’s Office of the Arts and the Department of Performing Arts. Their purpose is to design and develop online knowledge platforms and in-person gatherings that promote access, participation, organizational collaboration, field-wide research, and new teaching practices to illuminate the breadth, diversity, and impact of a commons-based approach to theater practice.

If you are curious to hear more about this work or how it’s going, [get in touch](/contact/).
