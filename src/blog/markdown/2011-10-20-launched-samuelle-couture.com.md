# Launched! Samuelle Couture

The artistry and integrity of [Sam Walls Beasley](http://samuellecouture.com/index.php?q=1)’s work is uncanny, she is a masterful seamstress. We are thrilled to have developed her website with our in-house CMS.

The website is nothing flashy. A simple under stated design that lets the work speak for itself. Work that is often in collaboration with leading designers in haute couture and high fashion. Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna, Mrs. Obama and most recently [Nancy McCartney](http://samuellecouture.com/blog.php) have all donned pieces tailored by Sam. Looking forward adding this to the portfolio. Until then enjoy these stunning photos of her work.
