# A Meditation for (US) Election Day


Resting in the center,
breathing in we take in this present moment,
breathing out we let go.
May each of us find peace, love and happiness.


May we meet fear with compassion,
anxiety with mindfulness,
and anger with love.


May we know, truly
That there is only this present moment:
Peace and stillness
In our hearts,
A drop of love,
A tear of acceptance,
An embrace of togetherness.


We send love and compassion
To those who are angry
And hurt this day. Who live in fear.
Who suffer under the terror
Of the illusion of separation.


May they too know this peace and love
Emanating from the heart of creation.


May they know that no matter what the outcome,
no matter what the darkness perceived,
Our rise continues. One by one.
Like the day and the rising sun.
Inevitable.
Unafraid, despite the ache...
Our rise continues, beyond egos and hate.
Elevating, climbing, to the highest peak.
Together, may we enjoy the vista that all humans seek.
