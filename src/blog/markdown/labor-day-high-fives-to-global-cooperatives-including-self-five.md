# Labor Day High Fives to Global Cooperatives (including self-five)

This Labor Day, CoLab is celebrating the burgeoning cooperative economy and our place in it. We are proud to be included in Shareable’s article highlighting worker-owned cooperatives who are “redefining the cooperative movement!”

A new economy is being forged and we are grateful to be so close to the fire that none of us have eyebrows anymore. It is exciting to be recognized as belonging to a network of coops such as Deca Stories, Seikatsu, and Cooperative Home Care Associates (to name just a few), entities that are truly making the world better place. These coops support their workers and lift their communities, not just by providing jobs, but providing good jobs where the workers have a voice and are empowered. Not only that, but these companies provide important services to their communities such as opportunities for delicious organic food, “deeply reported” journalistic portraits, and high quality home health care. It is an honor to be included in your ranks.

It is our intention to do our part by helping our clients and workers make their dreams into realities and financially flourish in the process. Here’s to a new way of making money! Here’s to a new way of supporting each other, and (as always) here’s to making the world a better place one collaborative session at a time.

Read [this very inspiring article](http://www.shareable.net/blog/16-worker-coops-redefining-the-cooperative-movement), and witness the new economy begin to unfold.
