# User, Worker, Owner!

<img src="/assets/img/blog/uwo-may2-oakland.png" class="center-element">

**Working in tech is a mix of privilege and pain.**

Each week, we struggle with how our values fit in our workplaces and platforms.

We're a group of tech workers and allies who see how the tech industry shapes our lives and data, and how it is complicit in forms of oppression, including racism, classism, sexism, cisgenderism, homophobia, and xenophobia. We believe there are alternatives, through equitable ownership and control. That's why weâ€™re organizing "User, Worker, Owner! Bringing Democracy to Work."

Our goal is to imagine a tech industry working towards non-exploitative, joyful, and humanizing futures. What would this industry look like if it was a part of the movement? How would decisions in companies get made, and who would have power? This gathering is for us to define problems in our workplaces and platforms, expand our imagination, find peers, get tools, and eat ice cream.

**Come be part of our gathering on May 2, 5-8pm at VSCO (1500 Broadway, Oakland)**
