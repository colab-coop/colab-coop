# Social Enterprise in New York Gets a Boost

<img src="/assets/img/blog/2012-04-27.jpg" class="center-element">

A new bill recently signed into law by NY State Governor will enable corporations to legally structure themselves as Benefit Corporations or B-Corps. B-Corps are for-profit entities that have a specific social mission.

The new law mandates that businesses focus on more than simply bottom-line profit, but impact from a social and environmental perspective when they make governance decisions. Prior to this updated framework, enterprises seeking to combine profit-making with doing good faced numerous challenges. Legal structuring, difficulty attracting capital and a thorny lanscape when selling or scaling their business.

New York is the second state to approve the law after California. As the two major economies in the US, this is a big deal for capitalism and a country, plagued by the self interest of big business. As social enterprise becomes a growing part of the economy, more states are expected to adopt these frameworks in order to keep businesses in their respective state.

> “As a result of this law passing, we’re planning to move our incorporation from Delaware to New York,” David Bolotsky, [UnCommon Goods](http://www.uncommongoods.com/)’ CEO, told GOOD contributor Alex Goldmark. “We want to show our support for the fact that socially responsible businesses now have a legal framework.”

It is our hope that progress like this, opens the door for an even deeper shift. Cooperatives, like us, for example, continue fly under the radar as a viable business model in most states.
