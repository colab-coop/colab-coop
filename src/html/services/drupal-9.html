      <p>
        If your organization uses Drupal for your websites, you have probably heard that Drupal 9 is coming this summer. Here’s information about Drupal 9 and how CoLab can help you upgrade your Drupal 7 or 8 sites to Drupal 9.

      <b>
        Most importantly: Drupal 9 is the only version that will continue to be supported in the long term.

          What does Drupal 9 have to offer?
        </h2>
      </strong>
      <p>
        Drupal is a content management system (CMS) that makes it easy for organizations to create and maintain large, complex websites with workflows, public and private sections, e-commerce, internationalization, and other advanced features. This widely-used, well-supported open source software has a large development community and works with hundreds of contributed add-on modules and integrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drupal 9 is an evolution of Drupal 8 -- it is essentially Drupal 8 with major dependencies (Symfony) updated and deprecated code removed. The transition from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 will be much simpler than the reimplementation required in the move from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.
      </p>
      <b>
        Many major new features were introduced in Drupal 8 and 9:

          Why upgrade to Drupal 9?
        </h2>
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Security:</b> It’s vital to use software that has active support for security fixes. The Drupal community releases security updates regularly, with specifics about what features are involved. Once your version of Drupal is no longer supported, there will no longer be security updates for your code and your website will be vulnerable.</li>
        <li><b>Continuing development:</b> New versions of Drupal 9 will be released every six months, with additional improvement and new features.</li>
        <li><b>Opportunity to make improvements:</b> Conducting regular audits of websites to see what is working and what are pain points is always a good idea. You may also want to do a design refresh at the same time.</li>
        <li><b>Assured upgrade path:</b> The Drupal community is committed to making upgrades from Drupal 9 to future versions of Drupal easy.</li>

          Moving from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 will be a much simpler process. After checking that your Drupal 8 code doesn’t use any deprecated APIs (for which there’s an automated tool), CoLab can help you to run a version update process and test!
        </p>
        <p>
          Likely there will be small fixes needed or possibly some programming work to complete if you are using custom modules, but the path forward and investment should be modest.

          The Drupal community recommends moving from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 as soon as possible, to prepare for the much simpler transition to Drupal 9. There is a stable migration path from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8, using the core Migration module to import your data into your new site.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are a lot of differences between Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 (or 9), and you’ll need to map out a re-implementation of your site using the new set of core and contrib modules. Many community contributed modules are in active development for Drupal 9 compatibility. Moving from D7 to D8 can be a heavy lift, but it sets you up for the future.

          CoLab has re-implemented many Drupal 7 sites in Drupal 8, with a dedicated Drupal Migration Team. We have an established process for Drupal migrations, including users, documents, images, nodes, workflows, roles, permissions, and redirects. We can recommend replacements for deprecated Drupal 7 modules. Our Migration Planning team can work with you to determine what to migrate into Drupal 9 and what to leave behind, including incorporating content clean-up in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve implemented these sites in Drupal 8:
