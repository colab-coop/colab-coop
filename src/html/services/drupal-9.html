        If your organization uses Drupal for your websites, you have probably heard that Drupal arrived in Deceber 2022. Here’s information about Drupal 9 and how CoLab can help you upgrade your Drupal 7, 8, or 9 sites to Drupal 10.

          What does Drupal 10 have to offer?
        </h2>
      </strong>
      <p>
        Drupal is a content management system (CMS) that makes it easy for organizations to create and maintain large, complex websites with workflows, public and private sections, e-commerce, internationalization, and other advanced features. This widely-used, well-supported open source software has a large development community and works with hundreds of contributed add-on modules and integrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drupal 10 is an evolution of Drupal 8 and 9 -- it is essentially Drupal 9 with major dependencies (Symfony) updated and deprecated code removed. The transition from Drupal 8 or 9 to Drupal 10 will be much simpler than the move from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10.
      </p>
      <b>
        Many major new features were introduced in Drupal 8 and 9:

          Why upgrade to Drupal 10?
        </h2>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Security:</b> It’s vital to use software that has active support for security fixes. The Drupal community releases security updates regularly, with specifics about what features are involved. Once your version of Drupal is no longer supported, your website will be vulnerable.</li>
        <li><b>Continuing development:</b> New versions of Drupal 10 will be released every six months, with additional improvement and new features.</li>
        <li><b>Opportunity to make improvements:</b> Conducting regular audits of websites to see what is working and what are pain points is always a good idea. You may also want to do a design refresh at the same time.</li>
        <li><b>Assured upgrade path:</b> The Drupal community is committed to making upgrades from Drupal 10 to future versions of Drupal easy. Updates from 8 to 9 to have have been straightforward, so they are keeping their word.</li>

          Moving from Drupal 8 or 9 to Drupal 10 is usually a simpler proces. After checking that your Drupal code doesn’t use any deprecated code (for which there’s an automated tool), CoLab can help you to run a version update process and test!
        </p>
        <p>
          Likely there will be small fixes needed or programming work to complete if you are using custom modules, but the path forward and investment should be modest.

          The Drupal community recommends moving from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10 as soon as possible. There is a stable migration path from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10 using the core Migration module to import your data into your new site.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are a lot of differences between Drupal 7 and Drupal 10 (or 8 or 9), and you’ll need to map out a re-implementation of your site using the new set of core and contrib modules. Many community contributed modules are in active development for Drupal 10 compatibility. Moving from D7 to D10 can be a heavy lift, but it sets you up for the future.
