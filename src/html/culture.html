      <h2 class="h1">We've got history.</h2>
      <p>CoLab was born in 2011 by a group of creatives, technologists and entrepreneurs. The founders began cultivating their relationships to one another over a decade ago. Fostering each others' individual growth and serving others were central to these friendships. This trusting foundation became part of the fabric of what is now CoLab Coop. Being of freelance and entrepreneurial backgrounds, CoLab sought a way to create opportunities to do what they loved - exploring technology, social progress, design, music and spirituality - while helping others to achieve their own dreams.</p>

      <p>This path forward, together, is shared now through the cooperative business model as co-owners of CoLab Coop.  We discovered that a coop enables each of us as worker-owners the freedom and responsibility to create an organization that reflects a shared set of core values rooted in a desire to make the world a better place.</p>
