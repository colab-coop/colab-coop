        <p>It all started with a beautifully practical purpose: Take human waste and turn it into fuel. The realization of this dream improved sanitation in the communities who embraced it, provided a sustainable fuel source, and decreased industrial production of CO2. Pivot Works was cleaning things up, but they still needed to improve the way they were sharing their good work with the world. That's when CoLab received a request: Could CoLab help Pivot Works make their site professional, polished, and help them develop their brand? Could we do it on a very tight timeline? Yes. We could.</p>

        <p>We hit the ground running with an audit of all the materials Pivot Works had to work with. They had some wonderful infographics that really inspired us. These images informed our design envisioning. Ultimately, the look and feel of the website wold be built upon the groundwork of these infographics.</p>
        <p>The super-human design talent Jenn Schlick headed the design team. Their work can be condensed into four key areas: visual consistency, custom icons, content, and infographics. We established brand identity through consistent typography and use of color then designed a set of custom icons to represent the company values. We reworked the existing copy for a web audience and added clear CTAs to help the company generate leads. The infographics we loved were tweaked to coincide with the new brand identity. As a final touch, new, high-impact photographs were inserted on each page.</p>

                <p>Working with CoLab was a great experience. Everyone was responsive and attentive to my company's needs. The team was creative and collaborative, being able to both take direction but also add insightful ideas and designs when we needed them to help us work out our ideas.</p>
                <p>I would highly recommend them for design and website work. In fact, the next time my company has any design needs we will go immediately back to CoLab.</p>

        <p>The combination of these small but smart tweaks and deeper refinements to the brands core had a profound effect on the website. The finished project was clean, professional, contemporary and reflective of the Pivot Works identity. This was achieved with great efficiency on a tight timeline. CoLab is proud of this work and grateful that we were able to contribute to an organization with such a profound social and environmental impact.</p>
