              <p>Jess was lucky enough to grow up trailing after her parents into Australia’s wilderness and now lives in Wales, where she has worked as an in-house web manager, agency SEO, run a small digital marketing company, and still spends a lot of time hiking, rock and ice climbing, and surfing. Although CoLab are on the other side of the ocean geographically, they’re right next door philosophically and that counts for more.</p>

              <p>Part rock climber and part mathematician, Jess believes in the conservation of wild spaces, protecting threatened species, and in the value of good data. Indoors, she has a PhD in data mining and deals with web analytics, paid advertising campaigns, and making meaningful, actionable information out of big collections of numbers. Outdoors, long days in mountains have taught her attention to detail, tenacity when dealing with tricky problems, and the value of a really good woolly hat.</p>
