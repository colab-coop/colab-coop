              <p>Ana tried her best to become an artist, a writer, or something bohemian like that, but at some point had to accept that her true talents lie in a more linear realm. PHP, MySQL, etc just seemed easier to learn than, for example, how to paint a masterpiece.</p>
              <p>So, she traded in her paints for a computer and is enjoying expressing both her linear and creative aspects through website development and cultural programming.</p>
              <p>Ana has been building websites with Drupal since Drupal 4.7 (2004). Her passion for design and development is rooted in a desire to make things work better. She strives to achieve a lean effect in her work: lightweight, user-friendly, and maximally conservative of resources. She is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design (Industrial Design) where she specialized in sustainable systems design. She brings with her 10 years of experience with technology and information systems design and development, and 15 years of design experience.</p>
