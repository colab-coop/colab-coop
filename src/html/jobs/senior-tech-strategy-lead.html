      <p>CoLab is looking for a senior tech strategist to help usher this 7+ year tech co-op into the next era of technology development.</p>
      <p>We are ready as an org to take a quantum leap forward as an organization; and we are hoping that you are likewise ready for a joyful shift! Prepare to roll up your sleeves to support our efforts to benefit the Common Good.</p>
      <p>Our vision is to build upon our extensive history of work, thought, and relationship building at the nexus between co-operativism, community cultural and economic development, and technologies of collaboration.</p>
      <p>We see emerging technologies such as blockchain technology and the decentralized autonomous organizations they support as offering a fundamental shift in the foundation of technical systems, a shift which redefines our ability to architect new co-operative systems of value exchange.  Decentralized collaboration coupled with advances in ethics and the emergence of a reconstituted civic virtue will we hope lead to more humane technologies and empowered communities.</p>
      <p>If this vision resonates with you, with your sense of life purpose, please read on…</p>
