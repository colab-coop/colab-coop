          <ul class="ul-default text--small">
            <li>You’ll need to be comfortable with basic workplace softwares such as word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software. We use Google Docs.</li>
            <li>You’ll need to be able to handle a moderate volume of email and requests with prompt responses.</li>
            <li>You’ll need to be comfortable managing your outstanding tasks and priorities using an online tool. We use JIRA and a wiki, but experience with some computer task list (even a text file) is important.</li>
            <li>You’ll need to have organizational skills and an enthusiasm for systems. A lot of the work you’ll be helping with is helping others keep organizational systems working and helping to improve those systems over time. Some experience with this sort of work and a disposition toward keeping things in order will be critical to your success.</li>
            <li>It would help for you to have some experience with online collaboration tools, such as wikis, forums, or groupware (like Basecamp). These systems are core to our work, and you can learn the specifics on the job, but some background will set you up well.</li>
            <li>Familiarity with web communication platforms &mdash; such as Twitter, Facebook and Youtube &mdash; is also a plus. The world we work in is built upon major web platforms, and understanding how to use them yourself and knowing some of the strategy behind how groups can best make use of them will position you well to interface with clients and project teams.</li>
            <li>Knowing some web technologies, such as basic HTML or CSS, is not required, but it would sure be cool.</li>
            <li>Knowledge of Quickbooks would be great.</li>
