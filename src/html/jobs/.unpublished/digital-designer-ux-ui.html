      <h2 class="center-text text--uppercase">Engage co-ops, empower communities</h2>
      <p>CoLab is looking for a Digital Designer to strengthen our human centered design approach in co-creating web technology. Founded in 2010, our cooperative now needs your help to further elevate our vision and maintain robust standards for digital product and web design.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to grow our design practice and team. We work at the intersection of cooperation, inclusion, and technology. We’re building on a history of unique collaboration with clients committed to economic justice, culture, and sustainability. We’re seeking a collaborator with at least 3-5 years job or project experience helping teams bring simple, purpose-driven products to life.</p>
      <p>A typical day might include; a 15 minute virtual check in with your team on Slack optimizing a marketing landing page. From there you’ll spend a couple hours revising a design based on comments in InVision or Figma in prep to present via Zoom to a client. Your team consists of a PM in East Oakland, a developer in Alabama, and another in New Delhi, India. If you have the chance, you’ll join the “CoLab Connect” to meet other CoLabrs and learn about the different governance goals and challenges facing the cooperative.</p>
      <p>If this resonates with you, please read on.</p>
