      <p>
        You’re looking out for others on the team. You’d rather solve a problem than worry about it. You practice in the ancient art of Project Management. Does that sound like you? If so, let’s talk about bringing those skills to CoLab Cooperative! We’re an international, worker-owned tech collective that builds custom apps and websites for a better world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The role of Project Manager is multifaceted—much like spinning plates. The position requires the ability to interact professionally in writing or on the phone with our clients. We seek someone who is very organized and detail-oriented, someone who can anticipate possible roadblocks or issues and work to resolve them before they get out of hand.
