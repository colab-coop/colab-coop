              <p>From the early days of IRC and chess matches on telnet servers, Sanjay has always been fascinated by technology. A web development career path was inevitable for Sanjay, having spent the majority of his formative years in his second home: the internet.</p>

              <p>After completing a diploma course in Urban Studies, Sanjay spent several years writing for non-profits and magazines. He met CoLab at the right time - burnt out as a contractor and evading the traditional corporate setup, Sanjay saw CoLab as "an alternative 3rd way."</p>

              <p>Sanjay is the resident standards geek, a close follower of web standards processes and mailing lists. He keeps CoLab on the cutting edge of the emerging languages and protocols that are growing on the web.</p>

              <p>In 2007, Sanjay co-founded an arts space called CAMP. In addition to becoming an active space at the confluence of art and technology in Bombay, CAMP is the recipient of a number of international awards and accolades.</p>

              <p>Most recently, Sanjay worked on a historical gazetteer project used by the Library of Congress and New York Public Library. He currently also works on developing the tech platform for the <a href="http://klp.org.in">Karnataka Learning Partnership</a>. He lives in Bombay and, in the non-digital world, is passionate about travel and enjoys playing cricket and table tennis.</p>
