              <p>When Mohd was a kid, he spent a lot of time by the sea in Mumbai, exploring and looking for sea creatures. When he wasn't adventuring, he was on his commodore computer, writing programs in basic which he would then save on audio tape. Sufficient to say, he got started on programming very early.</p>
              <p>The stage was set for Mohd's exemplary career in technologies at the Bombay International School, St. Xaviers College in Mumbai, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy NY, where he specialized in computer systems engineering. His professional accomplishments are numerous. He built SCADA software for Department of Atomic Energy in Manuguru, India, acted as consultant to Securities and Exchange Board of India for their IT needs, created his own CMS called ezCMS which is now being used internationally to build many sites, and built countless unique and imaginative programs.</p>
              <p>Mohd has over 18 years of experience in the IT industry. He is proficient in php, html, css, js, mysql, ms visual basic, and prides himself in learning new languages very quickly.</p>
              <p>It's true Mohd spends a lot of his time in front of his computer, but he loves the natural world; organic farming, camping, and traveling are his passions. Someday, he hopes to travel the world without using google maps.</p>
