              <p>Joshua was attracted to computers from an early age. Originally, it was a way to connect with people through language and imagination. The internet still serves as a imaginative playground for Joshua where he can turn ideas into reality.</p>

              <p>Joshua graduated with a bachelors of science from Northwestern University. He is an experienced web developer, focusing primarily on front-end technologies such as PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript. Joshua is the creator of a project management system called Tendfire. This strategic process provides structure for Joshua as he facilitates projects that flow smoothly between creative exploration, rigorous experimentation, and intentional action. Riding on the belief that the best ideas come from the heart and are executed by the mind, Joshua tailors his skill set with the intention of bringing the head and the heart into productive harmony. Joshuaâ€™s relentless drive to distill value, as well as his ability to steward an idea from conception through production and validation, make him a valuable asset to CoLab and its clients.</p>

              <p>Joshua loves music. He is a songwriter, singer, and plays the piano, mandolin, and guitar. He sometimes earns extra coins busking on city street corners. He doesn't do it for the coins, though. Everything he does is for the love of it.</p>
