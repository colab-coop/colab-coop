              <p>David is a technology enthusiast, futurist, and programmer. He is passionate about simplicity and collaboration, diagnosed with terminal case of wanderlust. Despite his technological leanings, he is also interested in natural building, permaculture, and has a "back to the land", simple living, Thoreauvian mentality.</p>

              <p>David earned an associate’s degree in electronics engineering and a BS in computer science. He's always loved to learn. In school he took many graduate-level computer science and math classes just for the fun of it. Today he works hard to keep up with programming innovations, playing with unusual languages and refreshing his knowledge of languages he's already skilled in.</p>

              <p>Spending much of his time abroad, he has developed a strong desire for egalitarianism and a more aware, compassionate world. He believes we are now at a crucial stage in human societal evolution where positive, radical change for good can be amplified and extended in ways never before possible.</p>

              <p>David is a founding member of the <a href="https://256.makerslocal.org">Maker’s Local 256</a> hackerspace in Huntsville, Alabama. He enjoys hiking, sailing, meditation, and vegetarian cooking. He hopes to help encourage a more DIY, participatory, and community-centered world.</p>
