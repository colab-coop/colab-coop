        <p>Back in 2008 Co-owner Ethan Winn was lead developer on a project with Seventh Generation when they first moved their site off a proprietary CMS and onto Drupal...version 5. Because the folks at Seventh Generation are an amazing, inspiring bunch of pioneers who have trail-blazed social entrepreneurship and values alignment long before they were mainstream, Ethan loved checking in with them over the years: hearing how their online presence was growing and how they were continuing to innovate over the years.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2014, Seventh Generation was in search of a tech team with deep experience in Drupal to help streamline some of the more complicated and intertwined systems that had evolved as their site continually modified to address their needs. Beyond our experience, two other factors led us to be well matched for this project: our focus on storytelling and our commitment to collaboration. The importance of storytelling speaks for itself these days, especially if your products are driven by high standards of ethics and sustainability. Being fresh off a successful launch of <a href="/work/unitarian-universalist-association">UAA.org</a>, our most collaborative project to date, CoLab was well positioned to meet Seventh Generation's needs. It has been a pleasure thus far to serve their team and their mission. We look forward to sharing more as we work to debug existing issues and provide a stable technical foundation for future plans.
