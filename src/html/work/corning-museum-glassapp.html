        <p>Corning Museum of Glass (CMoG) is a world class museum that has been generating a bit of buzz with the art and architectural community through the construction of its new contemporary wing . We joined up with their newly formed digital team to deliver an app to enhance exploration of this exciting new space. </p>

        <h2 class="text--align-center">GOALS</h2>
        <p>The primary goals of the app itself were straight forward:
        <ul class="">
        <li>1) Provide information about objects in the new contemporary wing.</li>
        <li>2) Provide visitor information, like museum hours and event schedules.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>But what if we could build the app in such a way that would eventually expand into all the other parts of the museum experience. The other galleries, the glass making demonstrations, the unique GlassLab design program? This was the underlying question that the Scott and the CMoG digital team presented to us. To date the museum had not dived very deep into mobile other than creating  m.cmog url that is functional but different from….. something something….</p>

        <p>Our conversations with the Blue Marble team helped us establish a direction for their website that reflected the personality of their organization.</p> 
        
        <p>Diving deep into the customer interviews, we focused on who Blue Marble was serving so the website’s content, design, and unique tools spoke directly to the target audience.</p>
        
        <p>The landscape analysis revealed competitors relying on formal language and laundry lists of services to appeal to a broad audience. BMP was different: focused on collaboration, personal relationships, and deeply dedicated to responsible stewardship of the planet. CoLab would tailor a website that celebrated and reflected this uniqueness.</p>

        <h2 class="text--align-center">CONTENT STRATEGY</h2>
        <p>Directly from our research came the content strategy. Through the magic of <a href="http://jessicasand.com/">Jess Sand</a>, data transformed into a site-flow, a rough map outlining the content and design.</p>
        
        <p>Here is where we hit one of the central challenges of the project: how do we explain the complex and unique services of BMP in down-to-earth, easily understood, plain English, and make it appealing to potential customers? It took trial, error, and collaboration to craft approachable content that allowed the group’s personality and work style to shine through.</p>

        <h2 class="text--align-center">BRANDING AND DESIGN</h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.neonbutterfly.com/">Abby Allen</a> guided the development of the brand, Jessica Peery created the logo design, and Ralph Cutler led the charge on web and mobile design. There was also significant collaboration with the Blue Marble team, who came to us with examples of the aesthetic they wanted to inspire us and provide direction.</p>
        <p>This project is an excellent example of content-first design. The actual design and UX (user experience) took cues from the content strategy we established early on. The framework of the website was built by aligning BMP’s core values with the specific needs of their target audience. Everything we did would be carefully crafted to best serve site visitors. Ralph translated this strategy into an aesthetic design that was both human, establishing trust with potential customer, and elegantly clean, reflecting BMP’s high level of professionalism.</p>

        <p><a href="/team/noam">Noam Eppel</a> designed the site in WordPress. This solution enabled the client to have ongoing control over their content. The development was optimized to ensure that the site loads and runs very fast. Their unique, custom designed menu looks good on desktops, laptops, and mobile devices.</p>

        <p>In the end, CoLab had the rewarding experience of collaborating to help Blue Marble Project expand their business and secure new opportunities.</p>
        <p>This project was a success thanks to the many complimentary disciplines working closely together to produce a holistic product: landscape analysis, brand identity, market research, content strategy, design work, marketing strategy, and content management system implementation.</p>
        <p>And, we had fun to boot! When asked about this project, CoLabr <a href="http://jessicasand.com/">Jess Sand</a> said:</p>
        <blockquote>
          Working with the CoLab team on this project was a blast; it’s hugely rewarding to be part of a team that is so collaborative and committed to excellent, client-driven work.
