        <p>Corning Museum of Glass (CMoG) is a world class museum that has been generating a bit of buzz with art and architectural communities through the construction of its new contemporary wing. As part of this expansion project, CoLab joined up with their digital department to boost capacity, deliver a new mobile app and enhance the overall museum experience for their guests.</p>
    
        <p>The project consisted of two parts, design and development of the “GlassApp” and digital signage redesign.</p>
        
        <p>The primary goals of the app were straight forward:
        
        <ul class="">
        <li>1) Unlock new information about objects in the new contemporary wing via rich media content</li>
        <li>2) Provide visitor information, like museum hours, event and demo schedules</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>But what if we could build the app in such a way that would eventually expand into all the other parts of the museum experience? The other galleries, the glass making demos, CMoG’s unique GlassLab design program? This was the underlying ambition that CMoG's digital team presented to us. </p>
        
        <p>Our answer was to create a sleek, efficient web application meant to deliver CMoG’s multimedia content directly to visitor’s mobile devices just like a native app. This approach met their short-term needs and sets them up well for the long term growth of the museum’s vision.</p> 
        
        <p>Aggressive timeline? What aggressive timeline?</p>

        <p>We ran design, front-end development and back-end API building in parallel with complete documentation. This
        enabled us to shave a 5 month build into about 3 months. They also came to us prepared with really great wireframes, a huge bonus.
        </p>
        
        <p>Given CMoG’s strong investment in a Drupal content management system to date, we were able to focus our technical collaboration on building a robust, independent web app backed by a ‘headless’ Drupal content API. Ethan provided senior architecture direction for building the front end framework of the application allowing CMoG's team to plug in via their Drupal API.</p>

        <p>The API powered app experience provides the foundation for expanding a tailored mobile experience to whole museum in the future. </p>

        <p>Oh, did we mention the entire museum was getting rebranded, too?</p>

        <p>There was an overarching initiative running concurrent with the completion of the new Contemporary wing. It was a total revamp of the CMoG brand properties. For Jenn and Ralph on design, this posed a unique challenge. The revamp was not complete and visibility into progress was limited. How does one design without reference to the final design style guide? In other relationships with less alignment and trust, that might lead to challenges, but in this case it ultimately allowed CoLab and CMoG’s digital team to think freely and work quickly on designing prototypes which was critical given the aggressive deadline. </p>

        <p>The prototyping process looked something like this:</p>
        <ul class="">
        <li>1) Take wireframes the CMoG team had shared and give feedback, explore options and polish</li>
        <li>2) As this happens turn the wires into a clickable prototype with light design touches</li>
        <li>3) Meet weekly to talk and review progress, iteratively layering on design fidelity to the prototype as we go.</li>
        <li>4) Move to development once all critical details are sorted and overall experience approved.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Actually this might sum it up better :)</p>
        <ul class="">
        <li>1) Don’t let users get to a place they can’t get out of</li>
        <li>2) Don’t let users get to a place they can’t get out of</li>
        <li>3) Don’t let users get to a place they can’t get out of</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With a clickable prototype signed off, it was time to hand off to front-end development and integration with the headless Drupal API. </p>

        <p>From there the design team the focus shifted to digital signage. Not a common project for CoLab but we welcomed an opportunity to expand our design thinking into architectural dimensions. You can see the results below:</p>
