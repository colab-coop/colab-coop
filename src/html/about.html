        <p class="heading-primary">Rationale</p>

        <p>The process above outlines the workflow that traditional UX and Lean UX operate inside, indicating the common ground for most product cycle engagement for any type of clients. At the start we are always in the Discovery phase, assessing what their needs are, as we try to bring them on board. Once they are on board, the process laid out above indicates how we can work through these various phases. This is not rigid nor fixed, as some projects require other touch points of discovery.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-border text--uppercase">Phase 1 - Discovery & Assessment</h2>

        <p>Our end goal here is to take this time to do our preliminary discovery research that will ultimately produce a high-level road map that the clients sign off on. This gets us all on the same page, ready to move through the project. It also gives us all adequate time to make sure that all the moving parts are on the table. Without that preparation, it's too easy to overlook things that can come back to throw us off track later on.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-border text--uppercase">Phase 2 - Design</h2>

        <p>Traditional design workflow follows in this fashion. Collaborative workshops typically follow the Discovery phase, affording us the opportunity to learn from and work with the SMEs on the clients' side. Though the MVP approach indicates the potential to work in a more lean fashion, we shouldn't consider this to apply to all projects, allowing for variation in preferred scope.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-border text--uppercase">Phase 3 - Product Development</h2>

        <p>This phase is meant to define our forward movement during the development and implementation cycles, be they Agile or otherwise. Working with our teams and the dev teams of the clients, we can tweak the steps required to ensure that the best workflow process evolves, adhering to the typical tracking tools and user validation analysis.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-border text--uppercase">Phase 4 - Success Metrics</h2>

        <p>This is pretty simple &mdash; without success metrics, you can't accurately track the data points needed to measure the various dimensions required to keep your business on track. Ideally, we can roll this information up into a data dashboard, enabling our clients to more quickly review the information, and therefore, more quickly respond.</p>
