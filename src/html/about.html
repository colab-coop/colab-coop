        CoLab Cooperative was founded in 2010 to co-create simple, purpose-driven web technology for a better world.
      </p>
      <p>
        CoLab was born of diversity, with intercultural collaboration a part of its organizational DNA. In growing, we have prioritized heart-centered and inclusive cooperation, welcoming committed and aligned collaborators into the owner-membership as they become woven into our team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we have member-owners on three continents, and a larger collaborator network in seven U.S. states and eight countries from Austin, Texas to Australia. Our humble headquarters is in Ithaca, New York. We run our office as coworking space called <a href="http://colabhive.com/">The Hive</a>.

        We’re proudly building platforms with clients ranging from established institutions like Virginia Tech University, or B-Corporations like Seventh Generation, to cooperatives like Green Worker Cooperative, and the innovative platform cooperative <a href="https://www.upandgo.coop/">Up&Go</a>, one of the only digital tools owned and governed by its members.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a co-op, we’re especially committed to cooperative alternatives. In 2017, we completed a study for the International Cooperative Alliance on financing for co-op startups, In 2018, we collaborated with Vancity Credit Union to validate new concepts for high-impact, community-led investment. In 2019 we are co-working with Democracy Collaborative on a report that gives an overview of the many models for scalable democratic organizations.
