                CoLab delivered 150% on the collaborative approach. That made a huge difference to the success of the project. They weren't just looking at the short-term goal, but also the long-term strategy for storytelling, user experience, performance and scalability. It was invaluable and they completely delivered in that regard.

              I was thrilled that CoLab provided major customization built around my needs as an artist and thought leader. Another aspect I really loved about their approach was the way in which all team members were engaged in the build out process and how they were very responsive to my goals overall. As a whole CoLab has excellent attention to detail and they build customized web tools that match the goals of the client and that can easily adapt to growth.
