              <p>Since pre-school, Steve has been taking things apart for the joy of seeing how they work, fixing them and putting them back together again. His first foray into software happened around 1980 on his family's new TRS-80 color computer complete with cassette tape backup. He learned the code behind two different maze games and then merged the best features from each into one game. Tech is simply in his blood.</p>

              <p>Steve graduated from the University of Michigan with a BS in Physics. For years he developed desktop database applications for small businesses before expanding to web technologies. He excels in WordPress, SQL and Javascript and still loves picking things apart to see how they work. Through many years of participation in Quaker meetings, he developed skills and experience with cooperative group decision making. This love for cooperation is what attracted Steve to CoLab. The culture and goals resonated with him, as well as the opportunity to be a part of a team whose collective skills strengthen each individual member.</p>

              <p>Steve's personal passions include gardening (last year he harvested 1,500 pounds of vegetables from his garden), his family, spirituality, and renewable energy. His goal is that someday his household and transportation fuels will be entirely renewable and sustainable.</p>
