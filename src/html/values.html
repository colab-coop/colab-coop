      <p>We put a great deal of stock in our values, and in the values that align us with the broader cooperative movement. CoLab supports and endorses the ten principles of the <a href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/">United Nations Global Compact</a>, as well as the <a href="http://ica.coop/">International Co-operative Alliance's</a> co-operative principles, both of which are provided below.</p>

      <h2 class="h2-border text--uppercase">The Co-operative Principles of The International Co-operative Alliance</h2>
      <div class="h3 center-text">Voluntary and Open Membership</div>
      <ol class="ol-default text--small">
        <li>Co-operatives are voluntary organisations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="h3 center-text">Democratic Member Control</div>
      <ol class="ol-default text--small" start="2">
        <li>Co-operatives are democratic organisations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="h3 center-text">Member Economic Participation</div>
      <ol class="ol-default text--small" start="3">
        <li>Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="h3 center-text">Autonomy and Independence</div>
      <ol class="ol-default text--small" start="4">
        <li>Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organisations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organisations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="h3 center-text">Education, Training and Information</div>
      <ol class="ol-default text--small" start="5">
        <li>Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="h3 center-text">Co-operation among Co-operatives</div>
      <ol class="ol-default text--small" start="6">
        <li>Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="h3 center-text">Concern for Community</div>
      <ol class="ol-default text--small" start="7">
        <li>Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.</li>
