        <b>Everything you need to know about Google's major Analytics Update</b>

        <div class="spacing--mid"></div>

        <h2 class="center-text text--uppercase">Overview</h2>

        <p>Google has released an exciting update to its widely used analytics platform. Unlike previous changes to the Google Analytics framework, Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is in effect a completely different platform with a completely different data model. It calls for a different event architecture and new code to be added to websites and other applications.</p>

        <h2 class="center-text text--uppercase">Highlights</h2>

        <p>Here are some of the biggest changes with GA4 that are relevant to most organizations tracking web analytics:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            GA4 tracks <i>events</i> instead of a series of webpage <i>visits</i>. 
            <br>
            This allows much greater potential in what can be tracked. Setting up the tracking for a new event is easier than before and has more options available
          </li>

          <li>
            GA4 focuses on the user journey. If a user starts on mobile and switches to desktop, GA4 can track that in ways that GA3 cannot. This is cross-device and cross-platform tracking. This also allows for tracking complex conversions.
          </li>
          <li>
            GA4 has predictive insight capabilities. It uses machine learning and probabilistic matching to allow greater analysis of overlapping data sets. 
          </li>
          <li>
            GA4 natively tracks data from apps as well as websites, which allows for seamless integration of the data.
          </li>
          <li>
            GA4 has far greater data visualizations capabilities.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="center-text text--uppercase">Updating your Analytics configuration.</h2>
        <i>Here's what you need to know</i>

        <div class="spacing--mid"></div>

        <h3>Goodbye Universal Analytics, Hello GA4!</h3>

        <p>
        By July 2023, Universal Google Analytics (the version you are likely using) will stop recording data entirely. Although no definite announcement has yet been made, it has also been implied that historical Universal GA data will not be available for viewing indefinitely.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>We highly recommend that all Google Analytics users migrate to GA4 as soon as possible</b> to allow for uninterrupted data collection as well as like-for-like year-on-year comparisons for this transitional period leading up to July 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
        For most sites, we are recommending running GA4 and Universal Google Analytics side by side from this point in time until July 2023, to allow for the least interruptions in data flow and longest possible run of data in GA4.
        </p>

        <h2 class="center-text text--uppercase">How Do I Navigate this Switch</h2>

        <p>
        Both GA3 and GA4 can, and ideally should be, set up through <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/">Google Tag Manager</a> (GTM).
        </p>

        <p>
        If you have existing Google Tags set up, some can be automatically migrated in the creation of the GA4 setup. Some will require extra configuring and Quality Assurance testing depending on the complexity of your setup.
        </p>

        <p>
        This is also the perfect opportunity to do some strategic work around your analytics trigger events, goal conversion targets &amp; tracking, sales funnels, and user flows that you want to prioritize, as well as other custom events tracking that is now possible. This is especially the time to integrate tracking of a website and an app if you have both.
        </p>
