      <p>The CoLab community is looking to welcome a unique soul who is passionate about collaboration, loves diving deep into the configuration of complex web systems, and understands what web developers and site owners need. As a cooperatively owned and managed company, we are dedicated to mutual support, deeply democratic decision making and full-hearted communication. If that makes you happy, we’d love to talk.</p>
      <p>Our systems administrators are best-prepared by at least 2 years of experience administering web systems and DevOps tools, as well as some form of relevant schooling, training or equivalent work experience. Because many of our tools are open source, involvement in some open source project will also be helpful.</p>

          <p class="text--small">We work with a range of tools and platforms, and while all of them are not required, experience with some of the following technologies is important to take on the tasks you’ll be responsible for:</p>

            <li>Familiarity with Atlassian products such as JIRA and Bitbucket, which we use to coordinate all projects.</li>

          <div class="spacing--sm-x"></div>
          <p class="text--small">This is a contract position. While there are no set hours, we do require candidates who are available for some meetings and calls during the bulk of US working hours and can commit to timely communication around in-progress items with developers based in the US, Europe and Asia.</p>
          
          <p class="text--small">We anticipate the job will involve 10-20 hours of work initially, as the systems are configured, for a period of one to two months. Following this the role will likely transition into process improvement and systems support, which may see either an increase or a decrease in hours depending on context.</p>
          
          <p class="text--small">CoLab is committed to a rich and diverse workplace. We are values-driven and respect the contributions brought by individuals of all backgrounds and identities. All individuals are encouraged to apply in their full, most unique, truest self.</p>
          
          <p class="text--small">Specifically, we are committed to building a team that is diverse in members’ gender identities, sexual preferences, racial identities, economic backgrounds, geographical locations, cultural heritages, ages, and religious practices. We hold everyone at CoLab accountable to upholding its principles of equity and diversity in all our practices. The sustainability and full realization of our business, ourselves and our society depends on it. We welcome feedback and collaboration on how we can do this better and where we might fall short.</p>
