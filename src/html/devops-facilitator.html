      <p>The CoLab community is looking to welcome a unique soul who is passionate about collaboration, loves diving deep into the configuration of complex web systems, and understands what web developers and site owners need. As a cooperatively owned and managed company, we are dedicated to mutual support, deeply democratic decision making and full-hearted communication. If that makes you happy, we’d love to talk.</p>
      
      <p>The DevOps Facilitator should have at least 2 years of experience working with DevOps tools with teams in production environments. They should be familiar and adept with systems administration concepts, able to effectively document and train developers in using DevOps processes to administer systems and able to create processes and configurations of key provisioning and other technologies to enable distributed administration of our development and production servers.</p>

          <p class="text--small">Your main responsibilities will be creating DevOps processes using provisioning and systems management tools (such as Ansible, Vagrant, and perhaps Docker). You should be familiar with the following:</p>
          <ul class="ul-default text--small">
            <li>Developer process documentation in software development and production release settings.</li>
            <li>Provisioning systems (Ansible and Puppet preferred, others open).</li>
            <li>DevOps Process Management (coordination via Git projects and other tools).</li>
            <li>Amazon Web Services administration (EC, S3, SES, etc.)</li>
            <li>Familiarity with deploying NodeJS, Drupal and/or Rails applications via DevOps tools is a plus.</li>

          <p class="text--small">As a cooperatively-run company, all roles at CoLab evolve and develop over time. As the DevOps facilitator you’ll be helping developers efficiently provision and manage systems by:</p>
          <ul class="ul-default text--small">
            <li>Developing standard processes and tools that allow developers to provision and manage the development environments for their projects.</li>
            <li>Auditing processes to ensure they are secure and scalable (across multiple projects with many teams).</li>
            <li>Documenting and training developers on the use of these standards and processes.</li>
            <li>Continually evaluating and improving DevOps practices.</li>

          <div class="spacing--sm-x"></div>
          <p class="text--small">This is a contract position. While there are no set hours, we do require candidates who are available for some meetings and calls during the bulk of US working hours and can commit to timely communication around in-progress items with developers based in the US, Europe and Asia.</p>
          
          <p class="text--small">We anticipate the job will involve 10-20 hours of work initially, as the systems are configured, for a period of one to two months. Following this the role will likely transition into process improvement and systems support, which may see either an increase or a decrease in hours depending on context.</p>
          
          <p class="text--small">CoLab is committed to a rich and diverse workplace. We are values-driven and respect the contributions brought by individuals of all backgrounds and identities. All individuals are encouraged to apply in their full, most unique, truest self.</p>
          
          <p class="text--small">Specifically, we are committed to building a team that is diverse in members’ gender identities, sexual preferences, racial identities, economic backgrounds, geographical locations, cultural heritages, ages, and religious practices. We hold everyone at CoLab accountable to upholding its principles of equity and diversity in all our practices. The sustainability and full realization of our business, ourselves and our society depends on it. We welcome feedback and collaboration on how we can do this better and where we might fall short.</p>
