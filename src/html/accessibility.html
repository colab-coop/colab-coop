        <p>
          As a diverse, inclusive worker-owned cooperative, we are committed to meeting the World Wide Web Consortium’s Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2.
        </p>

        <p>
          As of November 2023, we are building a new CoLab website in which all features will be accessible. We’re paddling as fast as we can.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will list all accessibility updates, as we implement them, on this page.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the meantime, if you find accessibility challenges on our current site, please email us.
