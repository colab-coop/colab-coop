              <p>Sean Foust has a passion for social entrepreneurship. He is inspired by the opportunity in business to propel environmental sustainability and social change. This opportunity is particularly vivid in the tech industry. Sean views the tech landscape as a kind of social change primordial soup, teeming with potentiality for positive growth.</p>

              <p>Sean taught himself about technology when he was a child, partially through experimenting on an Apple IIc and partially through pestering his older brother who was learning to code on their family's Linux box. In addition to his propensity for tech, Sean has a knack for organization, creative problem solving and research projects, skills which support CoLab's internal operations. He is entering his 7th year working with cooperatives.</p>

              <p>His passions include healthcare advocacy, green energy and permaculture design. When he isn't helping CoLab thrive, Sean spends his time listening to live music, hiking, camping, wildcrafting, kayaking, and doing all those things with the people that he loves.</p>
