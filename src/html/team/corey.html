                Corey's passion for technology stems back to his early experiments sequencing live music performances on a Commodore Amiga and mangling samples in an old, unreliable RT 6150 computer. An ardent lover of the outdoors and an avid mycophile, Corey finds constant sources of creative inspiration in the natural world.

                He is currently doing doctoral work at Cornell University with an emphasis on experimental and electronic music. He has previously held positions with the Melos Music Collective and the Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies, where he was assistant editor.  His interest in productive methodologies, work-flow enhancement, and collaborative partnerships led Corey to a Project Management position at CoLab, where he is able to foster greater understanding of the creative process.
