              <p>
                Temi loves helping productive teams build things that work. For as long as she can remember, she has always found something to plan or organise, so it made sense for her to become a (very good) project manager.
              </p>

              <p>
                She believes in technology’s ability to change lives and focuses her time working on projects that centre technology’s contribution to a better, more compassionate world.
              </p>

              <p>
                Books are Temi’s happy place and you can find her in a quiet corner with her Kindle, listening to music and trying to get through the mountain that is her reading list.
              </p>

              <p>
                She also loves tv shows and pop culture and will write you a strongly-worded essay on why Ted was the villain in “How I Met Your Mother”.
