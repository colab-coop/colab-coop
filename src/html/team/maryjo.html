              <p>MayJo's efforts are felt throughout many area of CoLab, you might call her a "Jo" of all trades. She graduated from the Terra Community College in Fremont, Ohio with a triple Associates degrees in American Sign Language, English Language and Literature and Social and Behavioral Science, then went on to raise 4 wonderful children. She brings to CoLab her rigorousness and her adaptability, working hard at dotting the Is and crossing the Ts in the accounting and HR departments. </p>

              <p>In the small village of Oak Harbor, Ohio where MaryJo lives, there’s only four stoplights, everyone knows everyone, the land is very flat, and the big town event is Apple Fest. That doesn’t stop MaryJo from going on adventures with her children in tow, often embarking on the 7 hours (8 hours with kids!) drive to her hometown of Ithaca, New York. </p>

              <p>Computers came naturally to MaryJo as she was raised by a tech-friendly father. Her and her sister grew up with terminals in their rooms, hooked up so that they could type back and forth. That led her to study programming before moving on to sign language. Today, she’s excited to be part of a team which allows her to learn new skills, meet with people around the world and still be a stay-at-home-mom.</p>
