                Santiago is a trained social worker with a techie mindset, a sometimes strange mix that has taken him on a ride to different experiences in marketing, sales, community social work, product management and business process management. He believes that one of the best ways to get people to share a vision and move past division is by collectively visualizing complex processes and interactions, so everyone can share their own perspectives and solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Santiago lives with wife Camila and son Isaac in Colombia, a beautiful land with a complex past, one which -  he is convinced - must travel a road of social and cooperative economy to heal trauma, rebuild trust and create a new sacred economy. Currently working towards awareness of the worker coop model in Colombia where it hasn't had the opportunity to flourish; specifically by promoting the incubation model he experienced while working as coop developer in Center for Family Life, Brooklyn.

                Santiago is known for using a lot of adjectives, laughing riotously and smiling wide.
