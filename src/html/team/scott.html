              <p>Scott enjoys dissecting a problem to its core and finding the simplest solution.  Coupled with a creative desire, he has embraced software development as an outlet for these impulses.  He hopes to reach and empower others through the technology that he helps build.

              <p>Scott received a B.S. from McGill University in Mathematics and Computer Science.  Since graduating, he has had the privilege of working on a variety of teams and projects focused primarily around building web and mobile applications.  He was drawn to CoLab by the collaborative spirit that runs in our DNA and our emphasis on working with socially responsible organizations.</p>

              <p>When he is not working in code, Scott enjoys playing music and spending time outdoors.  He has been playing music in various bands for the past decade and, as an avid outdoorsman, he can often be found in the woods- hiking, biking, camping, or skiing.</p>
