              <p>
              Since 2018, Marvin has been using NetSuite to help food banks automate their operations. When he realized that working with a group of developers committed to shared ownership would help him extend this service to other food banks, he joined CoLab.
              </p>
              <p>
              What he loves about working with food banks is that there is always a new problem to solve. His mindset is never “it can’t be done”, but rather “how do we do it?”
              </p>
              <p>
              Marvin is inspired by collaborative worker ownership, and discovering what accountability looks like in an organization like CoLab. He feels this is something the world needs to explore to eliminate worker exploitation.
              </p>
              <p>
              On his own time, Marvin studies political and social science.
              </p>
              <p>
              Previously based in California, in February 2024, Marvin and his wife relocated to her native Taiwan.
