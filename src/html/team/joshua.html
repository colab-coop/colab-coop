              <p>Joshua was attracted to computers from an early age. Originally, it was a way to explore the world of ideas and connect with a wide variety of people through language and imagination. The internet still serves as a laboratory and playground for Joshua where he can collaborate with others to bring creative ideas to life.</p>

              <p>Using his "Tendfire" project management process, Joshua facilitates projects that flow smoothly between creative exploration, rigorous experimentation, and conscious reflection. His years of professional experience in all aspects of the web development process — including strategy, project management, design, front-end and back-end development, and analytics — allow him to communicate and coordinate with specialists, communicate in plain-language with entrepreneurial partners, and even roll up his sleeves to assist the team with extra production muscle when necessary. His relentless drive to clarify and distill the essential human value of a venture, as well as his ability to steward an idea from conception through production and validation, make him a valuable asset to CoLab and its clients.</p>

                <p>Joshua also loves music. He is a songwriter and singer who also plays the piano and mandolin, sometimes earning extra coins busking on city street corners. He doesn't do it for the coins, though. Everything he does is for the love of it.</p>
