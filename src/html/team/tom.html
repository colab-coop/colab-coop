              Tom serves as CoLab’s expert on all things Shopify. He also supports our business development team, bringing extensive knowledge of ecommerce plus strong organization, communication, and design aesthetics.  Tom was drawn to tech for the creative aspect and potential for self actualization. He loves learning new languages and application development.

              His work with Shopify really began to take off in 2015 when he launched Hillary Clinton’s merch store (after successfully lobbying against the ecommerce platform used by Obama). This was the first ever Shopify store for what would become a nominated presidential candidate. The store shattered records set by Obama despite Clinton’s lower popularity and election loss.
