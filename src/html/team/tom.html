              In 2015 Tom launched the first ever Shopify store for what would become a nominated presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. The store shattered records created by any previous or competing presidential campaign. Since 2016 Tom has gone on to provide ecommerce services for hundreds of the most iconic political candidates and progressive organizations within the United States.
