              <p>Eli trained in the Product Design program (a blend of industrial design and mechanical engineering, which emphasizes “design thinking”) at Stanford University, graduating in 1998. While at Stanford, he also studied printmaking (with the Mexican-born artist Enrique Chagoya) and photography, subjects he found far more engaging than the advanced calculus courses he kept falling asleep in. From there, he worked in Bermuda at the Bermuda Biological Research Station, where he was certified as a research diver and assisted scientists with their work, learning more about the mating habits of coral than he cares to repeat.</p>
              <p>Sufficiently addicted to the underwater environment, he took a job at Light &amp; Motion in Monterey, California as a design engineer, where he had the chance to design, test, and flood many different types of underwater video and camera housings (he also became even more addicted to photography). He then worked on his master’s degree in marine biology at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories for four years. In a mad attempt to fuse his love of photography and the ocean, he started the magazine Wetpixel Quarterly in 2007 together with Eric Cheng. Eli currently lectures &amp; coaches in the Product Design program at Stanford. He continues to try his best to work with companies and individuals that are aligned with his interests, including sustainable food &amp; wine, earth-friendly building, yoga, surfing, diving, and almost anything related to the ocean.</p>
