              <p>At some point during his high school years, Jeremy accidentally ate the red pill instead of the more harmless blue one; he has been an activist for social justice ever since.</p>

              <p>A full-stack Drupal developer specializing in tricky bugs, migrations, and Drupal scaling, Jeremy loves elegant usability, readable code, and maintainable open-source solutions--after all, what good is technology when it isn't usable, sustainable, and accessible?</p>

              <p>Jeremy is generally a radical, but unpredictably so.  He is a poet, as well as a disciple of the quixote. Though a completely untrained theologian, he works to disrupt the money-based economy with a love-based model.  He is working on a personal website designed to connect churches, mosques, and synagogues directly with farmers in order to bring fresh produce to those in need.</p>
              <p>As an author, Jeremy is currently writing a dystopian science-fiction novel, and his work as a blogger can be found scattered across the interwebs.  <p>
