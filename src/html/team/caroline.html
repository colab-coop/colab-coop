                Caroline is the six-foot tall daughter of a tobacco farmer who, according to family lore, was the first Woolard to go to college. Caroline knows how hard her family worked in order for her to get where she is today.  As such, she takes dignified work, healing, and play quite seriously.
              </p>

              <p>
                After attending the only tuition-free art school in the country (Cooper Union), Caroline became obsessed with spaces for cultural equity and resource sharing.  To date, she has co-founded three collaborative, resource-sharing groups: <a href="http://ourgoods.org/"> OurGoods.org </a> , <a href="http://tradeschool.coop/story"> TradeSchool.coop </a> , and <a href="http://bfamfaphd.com/"> BFAMFAPhD.com </a> .  She currently works as a part-time faculty member at the <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/faculty.aspx?id=91929"> New School </a> and the <a href="http://www.sva.edu/faculty/caroline-woolard"> School of Visual Arts </a>, and she is an accomplished artist and speaker. In 2014, she delivered the 24th annual E. F. Schumacher Lecture in New York City. Three documentaries showcasing her work are forthcoming from PBS’s show, Art21’s <a href="http://www.art21.org/newyorkcloseup/films/caroline-woolard-flips-the-real-estate-script/">New York Close Up.</a>
              </p>

              <p>
                Caroline came to CoLab through her work with <a href="http://www.lauraflanders.com/team"> The Laura Flanders Show </a> and brings with her a strong background in project management, visual art, solidarity economics, philanthropy, and social enterprise. She strives to work in collaborative teams with rigor and generosity, and she believes that with mutual respect, anything is possible. When she's not playing soccer, collaborating on an art project, teaching, or caring for her family, Caroline is proud to serve as a project manager for CoLab.
