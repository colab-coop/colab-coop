              <p>Peter Ozolins can take a chaotic space and make it navigable, functional; he can return it to simplicity. He does this in the data-driven world of 1s and 0s and in his other job as an arborist where he specializes in the removal of old broken-down structures. Peter is both highly logical and creative. His first degree was in cinema and photography, followed up by a degree in web design with an emphasis on computer science. He excels behind the camera and the computer by finding order and creating balance.</p>

              <p>He has always had an interest in technology, finding himself inspired by the endless possibilities for benefit and enrichment. Computers are great at supporting people in pursing their dreams and skills. Peter loves his role in optimizing the ability of technology accomplish this.</p>

              <p>When he is not exploring how software can support people and bring them together, Peter is a photographer and a cyclist. Behind the camera, he is a storyteller. On his bicycle, he is an explorer and a competitor. Heâ€™s traveled all over the United States, France, and Spain training and competing. Seeking challenge, overcoming, and persevering makes Peter feel alive and engaged with the world.</p>
