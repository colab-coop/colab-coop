              <p>Claire lives and breathes marketing. Originally hailing from London (her undergraduate degree is from Goldsmiths), she completed a MSc in Marketing from the University of Glamorgan, a professional certificate in social media from the Institute of Direct Marketing (IDM), and is a member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing. Claire brings this extensive training to a variety of digital marketing and SEO projects for CoLab clients and collaborators.</p>

              <p>Claire describes her interest in SEO starting about twenty years ago while working for an adventure company in Pembrokeshire, her current place of residence in Wales. “I wanted to work out how to rank the website well,” Claire notes, “and it pretty much took off from there.” The company’s digital presence subsequently flourished, and she really began her marketing career. At that time, Claire began her MSc with a dream be a marketer working with clients she respects and believes in. </p>

<p>In her work with CoLab, Claire appreciates the ability to collaborate with progressive organizations on a team that is geographically dispersed yet united in its commitment to cooperative values and global compassion. Recently Claire helped refugees and migrants in Calais, France, through grassroots organizing and action. Furthermore, as a supporter of causes like <a href="https://www.msf.org.uk/">Médecins sans frontières</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org.uk/">Unicef</a>, and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a>, Claire is no stranger to the collective struggle to make the world a better place.</p>
