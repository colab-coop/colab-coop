              <p>As a multi-talented developer and designer, Dave has developed a number of Drupal websites over the past fifteen years, while also providing other technical services, for progressive social movements.</p>
<p>These causes range from autonomous housing struggles in Europe to anti-war efforts in Croatia and the US, to criminal justice reform and anti-prison expansion efforts, to community controlled cell phone networks in Mexico, to work with solar power installations.</p>
<p>Dave has worked on numerous websites as a developer while also designing posters, graphics, and newsletter and publication layouts for his activist causes.</p>
<p>Dave grew up between Yugoslavia and Austria, eventually settling in Philadelphia, where he has lived now for twenty years. Between Drupal projects, he spends his time gardening with his daughter and partner.</p>
