              <p>It was the promise of democratic access to knowledge that first attracted Jenn to technology. All of the information she needed to make websites was right there, if she could only teach herself. Designing with code appealed to both aspects of Jenn's brain, a little bit mechanical and a little bit lyrical.</p>

              <p>Jenn graduated with honors from the University of Maine with a bachelor of arts in journalism and English. She joined Carbonite during its first years, designing websites and marketing campaigns. Her subsequent work as a consultant included usability research, interface design and product management for MA Health Connector, iRobot and brands like Woolrich and American Eagle. At the digital agency Echo &amp; Co., she was fortunate to have a hand in creating technology solutions for social good. These values have been an important part of her work ever since.</p>

              <p>At CoLab, Jenn enjoys being challenged and challenging others to do their best work. She finds immense value in being part of a close-knit team that pushes each other forward.</p>
