              <p>Brendon taught himself to program at age 10, and has been involved with software development ever since. After more than 20 years of experience, he has taken on many roles, from engineer and technical co-founder, to systems admin and customer support. He prefers to call himself a company builder more than simply a programmer. With CoLab, Brendon analyzes data to help make better decisions and products with our clients. He has been a long time collaborator and trusted advisor to CoLabâ€™s founding team. </p>

<p>Brendon lives in Santa Monica, California. He supports Free/Libre and Open Source Software. Some of the projects he contributes to include Django, Celery, Piwik Open Analytics, JSLint, and Strophejs.
