              	<p>Rylan is driven by a personal mission to co-develop solutions that address the positive transformation and evolution of society, community and planet - a theme he explored deeply while studying the intersection of technology, anthropology and biology at Stanford University.</p>
		<p>Upon graduation, Rylan began cultivating technology expertise with an eye on this social impact mission by working at a Silicon Valley venture capital firm where his focus was on understanding and meeting the capital needs of technology startup ventures.  During this time he came to better understand startup finance models, their benefits and limitations, as well as possible contributions alternative economic models could make towards sustainable economic growth and social impact work.</p>
		<p>From finance, Rylan embarked on a long journey as a technology developer working through the various aspects of social enterprise entrepreneurship from co-founding a cause campaign startup, GiveBack, to consulting on business strategy with Fortune 500 companies, to rolling up his sleeves as a front-end web engineer. With help from peers, Rylan converted one of these early technology experiments he co-founded into the co-operative that CoLab is today.</p>
		<p>Rylan now enjoys collaborating with mission-driven entrepreneurs, activists, educators and organizers to co-create a brighter future one human interaction at a time.   At CoLab, Rylan serves as a member-owner working as a business development strategist, a product designer and an evangelist of the co-operative movement.</p>
