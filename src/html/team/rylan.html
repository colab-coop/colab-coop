              	<p>Rylanâ€™s mission is to co-develop solutions supporting the evolution of community and planet: a theme he explored deeply while studying at the intersection of technology, anthropology and biology at Stanford University. </p>

<p>Rylan began his professional journey cultivating technology expertise by working at a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.  There he placed his focus on understanding the capital needs of social enterprise technology ventures and envisioning alternative economic models for financing co-operative development.  </p>

<p>From finance, Rylan embarked on a journey as a developer and entrepreneur co-founding a technology startup, GiveBack; consulting on business strategy with Fortune 500 clients; and rolling up his sleeves as a front-end web engineer via a digital agency founded with his wife, Jessica.  One of these early technology experiments was converted into the co-operative that is CoLab Co-op today.</p>

<p>Rylan now enjoys collaborating with his peers to support mission-driven entrepreneurs, educators, activists, and organizers to co-create a brighter future one human interaction at a time.   At CoLab, Rylan serves as a member-owner working as a technology strategist, a product designer and a financial liaison to the tech co-op movement.  </p>

<p>On the personal front, Rylan is a father of 5, a lifelong outdoor adventurer, surfer, yogi, and a novice permaculture enthusiast.  Rylan is fascinated by the potential of decentralized networks, interactive art and blockchain technology to transform the future.
