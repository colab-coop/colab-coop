                As a CoLab Project Manager, Doug works with organizations, firms, and individuals to create beautifully elegant technology and design solutions. Doug does this while attending to the individual needs of each client alongside the production schedules of CoLab’s collaborators.
              </p>

              <p>
                Suffering from multiple professional personas, Doug is an accomplished artist, writer, and musician and came to CoLab after years of work for New York City tech startups. He became involved in the tech industry after developing a Python application in grad school that composes music by automatically transcribing recordings.
              </p>

              <p>
                Doug grew up in Augusta, Georgia, birthplace of renowned opera singer Jessye Norman, celebrated painter Jasper Johns, and James Brown. He attended a magnet school for the arts and eventually completed a PhD, which altogether took him from Boston to LA to Buffalo to Berlin.
              </p>

              <p>
                Doug is an avid supporter of social justice movements and loves CoLab’s commitment to its range of causes. In addition to collaborating with groups like <a href="http://www.actupny.org/">ACT UP</a> and <a href="http://strikedebt.org/">Strike Debt</a>, Doug has written extensively on socially engaged art and music practices in his latest book <a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/after-sound-9781501308123/">After Sound</>.
