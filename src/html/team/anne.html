              <p>Coming to us from an extensive design background, Anne Barkett has joined the ranks of our Wordpress team at CoLab, offering clients many years of technical expertise in addition to her aesthetic eye.  Over the years, she has sought out new challenges and opportunities to hone her web-development skills. Anne’s entry to computer programming was through an old Apple IIC, and she eventually took herself on to HTML/CSS and later Wordpress.  Her interest in design coupled with her technical curiosity and interest in self-employment made a position with CoLab seem like the perfect fit.  Like many of us, Anne is also enthusiastic about the outdoors -- hiking and gardening, primarily -- and is an ardent lover of cats and the arts (who doesn’t love cats and the arts?).  We’re excited to welcome her to the team, and look forward to supporting her continued development of design skills, in addition to our clients’ websites.</p>
