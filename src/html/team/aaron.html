              <p>Aaron has always loved problem-solving. From a young age, when he wanted to take a break from homework, he would head to math and physics problems. Aaron has a degree in comparative world religions from Friends World, an international school that allowed him to study in the Middle East, India and Asia. This rich educational experience permanently infected Aaron with a bug for traveling and backpacking.</p>

              <p>What started as "going where the cool kids are hanging out" turned into a deeper working relationship for Aaron. He believes in continuous personal integration, innovation, and the pursuit of excellence; he has found CoLab the ideal place to put his beliefs into practice.</p>

              <p>Aaron has 15 years of experience as a web developer and consultant, a journey that has allowed him to ride various emerging development waves, including JavaScript, AJAX, Flash, object-oriented programming, MVC, Ruby and responsive design. He currently specializes in Drupal development. In his spare time, Aaron contributes to Drupal 8 and experiments with <a href="//www.ansible.com">Ansible</a>, an IT automation framework. He has meditated daily since the mid-90s. Aaron regularly plays basketball, softball, billiards, and supports his two sons in their local First Lego League Robotics club.</p>
